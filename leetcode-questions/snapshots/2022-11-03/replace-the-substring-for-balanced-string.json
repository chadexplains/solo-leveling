  "description": "You are given a string s of length n containing only four kinds of characters: 'Q', 'W', 'E', and 'R'.\n\nA string is said to be balanced if each of its characters appears n / 4 times where n is the length of the string.\n\nReturn the minimum length of the substring that can be replaced with any other string of the same length to make s balanced. If s is already balanced, return 0.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = \"QWER\"\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: s is already balanced.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s = \"QQWE\"\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: We need to replace a 'Q' to 'R', so that \"RQWE\" (or \"QRWE\") is balanced.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: s = \"QQQW\"\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: We can replace the first \"QQ\" to \"ER\". \n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\tn == s.length\n\t4 <= n <= 105\n\tn is a multiple of 4.\n\ts contains only 'Q', 'W', 'E', and 'R'.\n\n"
