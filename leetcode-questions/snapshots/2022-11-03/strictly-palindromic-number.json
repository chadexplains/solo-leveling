  "description": "An integer n is strictly palindromic if, for every base b between 2 and n - 2 (inclusive), the string representation of the integer n in base b is palindromic.\n\nGiven an integer n, return true if n is strictly palindromic and false otherwise.\n\nA string is palindromic if it reads the same forward and backward.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: n = 9\nOutput: false\nExplanation: In base 2: 9 = 1001 (base 2), which is palindromic.\nIn base 3: 9 = 100 (base 3), which is not palindromic.\nTherefore, 9 is not strictly palindromic so we return false.\nNote that in bases 4, 5, 6, and 7, n = 9 is also not palindromic.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: n = 4\nOutput: false\nExplanation: We only consider base 2: 4 = 100 (base 2), which is not palindromic.\nTherefore, we return false.\n\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t4 <= n <= 105\n\n"
