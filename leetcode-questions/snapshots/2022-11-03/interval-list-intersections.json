  "description": "You are given two lists of closed intervals, firstList and secondList, where firstList[i] = [starti, endi] and secondList[j] = [startj, endj]. Each list of intervals is pairwise disjoint and in sorted order.\n\nReturn the intersection of these two interval lists.\n\nA closed interval [a, b] (with a <= b) denotes the set of real numbers x with a <= x <= b.\n\nThe intersection of two closed intervals is a set of real numbers that are either empty or represented as a closed interval. For example, the intersection of [1, 3] and [2, 4] is [2, 3].\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: firstList = [[0,2],[5,10],[13,23],[24,25]], secondList = [[1,5],[8,12],[15,24],[25,26]]\nOutput: [[1,2],[5,5],[8,10],[15,23],[24,24],[25,25]]\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: firstList = [[1,3],[5,9]], secondList = []\nOutput: []\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t0 <= firstList.length, secondList.length <= 1000\n\tfirstList.length + secondList.length >= 1\n\t0 <= starti < endi <= 109\n\tendi < starti+1\n\t0 <= startj < endj <= 109 \n\tendj < startj+1\n\n"
