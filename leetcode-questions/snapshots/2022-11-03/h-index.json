  "description": "Given an array of integers citations where citations[i] is the number of citations a researcher received for their ith paper, return compute the researcher's h-index.\n\nAccording to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: A scientist has an index h if h of their n papers have at least h citations each, and the other n − h papers have no more than h citations each.\n\nIf there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.\nSince the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: citations = [1,3,1]\nOutput: 1\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\tn == citations.length\n\t1 <= n <= 5000\n\t0 <= citations[i] <= 1000\n\n"
