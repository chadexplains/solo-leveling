  "description": "You are given an integer array bloomDay, an integer m and an integer k.\n\nYou want to make m bouquets. To make a bouquet, you need to use k adjacent flowers from the garden.\n\nThe garden consists of n flowers, the ith flower will bloom in the bloomDay[i] and then can be used in exactly one bouquet.\n\nReturn the minimum number of days you need to wait to be able to make m bouquets from the garden. If it is impossible to make m bouquets return -1.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: bloomDay = [1,10,3,10,2], m = 3, k = 1\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: Let us see what happened in the first three days. x means flower bloomed and _ means flower did not bloom in the garden.\nWe need 3 bouquets each should contain 1 flower.\nAfter day 1: [x, _, _, _, _]   // we can only make one bouquet.\nAfter day 2: [x, _, _, _, x]   // we can only make two bouquets.\nAfter day 3: [x, _, x, _, x]   // we can make 3 bouquets. The answer is 3.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: bloomDay = [1,10,3,10,2], m = 3, k = 2\nOutput: -1\nExplanation: We need 3 bouquets each has 2 flowers, that means we need 6 flowers. We only have 5 flowers so it is impossible to get the needed bouquets and we return -1.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: bloomDay = [7,7,7,7,12,7,7], m = 2, k = 3\nOutput: 12\nExplanation: We need 2 bouquets each should have 3 flowers.\nHere is the garden after the 7 and 12 days:\nAfter day 7: [x, x, x, x, _, x, x]\nWe can make one bouquet of the first three flowers that bloomed. We cannot make another bouquet from the last three flowers that bloomed because they are not adjacent.\nAfter day 12: [x, x, x, x, x, x, x]\nIt is obvious that we can make two bouquets in different ways.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\tbloomDay.length == n\n\t1 <= n <= 105\n\t1 <= bloomDay[i] <= 109\n\t1 <= m <= 106\n\t1 <= k <= n\n\n"
