  "description": "You are given two integers m and n, which represent the dimensions of a matrix.\n\nYou are also given the head of a linked list of integers.\n\nGenerate an m x n matrix that contains the integers in the linked list presented in spiral order (clockwise), starting from the top-left of the matrix. If there are remaining empty spaces, fill them with -1.\n\nReturn the generated matrix.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: m = 3, n = 5, head = [3,0,2,6,8,1,7,9,4,2,5,5,0]\nOutput: [[3,0,2,6,8],[5,0,-1,-1,1],[5,2,4,9,7]]\nExplanation: The diagram above shows how the values are printed in the matrix.\nNote that the remaining spaces in the matrix are filled with -1.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: m = 1, n = 4, head = [0,1,2]\nOutput: [[0,1,2,-1]]\nExplanation: The diagram above shows how the values are printed from left to right in the matrix.\nThe last space in the matrix is set to -1.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= m, n <= 105\n\t1 <= m * n <= 105\n\tThe number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, m * n].\n\t0 <= Node.val <= 1000\n\n"
