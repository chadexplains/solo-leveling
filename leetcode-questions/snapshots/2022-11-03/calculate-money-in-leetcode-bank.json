Every day from Tuesday to Sunday, he will put in $1 more than the day before. On every subsequent Monday, he will put in $1 more than the previous Monday. \n\nGiven n, return the total amount of money he will have in the Leetcode bank at the end of the nth day.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: n = 4\nOutput: 10\nExplanation: After the 4th day, the total is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: n = 10\nOutput: 37\nExplanation: After the 10th day, the total is (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7) + (2 + 3 + 4) = 37. Notice that on the 2nd Monday, Hercy only puts in $2.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: n = 20\nOutput: 96\nExplanation: After the 20th day, the total is (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7) + (2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8) + (3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8) = 96.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= n <= 1000\n\n"
