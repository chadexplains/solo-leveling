  "description": "You are given two 2D integer arrays, items1 and items2, representing two sets of items. Each array items has the following properties:\n\n\n\titems[i] = [valuei, weighti] where valuei represents the value and weighti represents the weight of the ith item.\n\tThe value of each item in items is unique.\n\n\nReturn a 2D integer array ret where ret[i] = [valuei, weighti], with weighti being the sum of weights of all items with value valuei.\n\nNote: ret should be returned in ascending order by value.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: items1 = [[1,1],[4,5],[3,8]], items2 = [[3,1],[1,5]]\nOutput: [[1,6],[3,9],[4,5]]\nExplanation: \nThe item with value = 1 occurs in items1 with weight = 1 and in items2 with weight = 5, total weight = 1 + 5 = 6.\nThe item with value = 3 occurs in items1 with weight = 8 and in items2 with weight = 1, total weight = 8 + 1 = 9.\nThe item with value = 4 occurs in items1 with weight = 5, total weight = 5.  \nTherefore, we return [[1,6],[3,9],[4,5]].\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: items1 = [[1,1],[3,2],[2,3]], items2 = [[2,1],[3,2],[1,3]]\nOutput: [[1,4],[2,4],[3,4]]\nExplanation: \nThe item with value = 1 occurs in items1 with weight = 1 and in items2 with weight = 3, total weight = 1 + 3 = 4.\nThe item with value = 2 occurs in items1 with weight = 3 and in items2 with weight = 1, total weight = 3 + 1 = 4.\nThe item with value = 3 occurs in items1 with weight = 2 and in items2 with weight = 2, total weight = 2 + 2 = 4.\nTherefore, we return [[1,4],[2,4],[3,4]].\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: items1 = [[1,3],[2,2]], items2 = [[7,1],[2,2],[1,4]]\nOutput: [[1,7],[2,4],[7,1]]\nExplanation:\nThe item with value = 1 occurs in items1 with weight = 3 and in items2 with weight = 4, total weight = 3 + 4 = 7. \nThe item with value = 2 occurs in items1 with weight = 2 and in items2 with weight = 2, total weight = 2 + 2 = 4. \nThe item with value = 7 occurs in items2 with weight = 1, total weight = 1.\nTherefore, we return [[1,7],[2,4],[7,1]].\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= items1.length, items2.length <= 1000\n\titems1[i].length == items2[i].length == 2\n\t1 <= valuei, weighti <= 1000\n\tEach valuei in items1 is unique.\n\tEach valuei in items2 is unique.\n\n"
