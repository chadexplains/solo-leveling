  "description": "Given a positive integer k, you need to find the length of the smallest positive integer n such that n is divisible by k, and n only contains the digit 1.\n\nReturn the length of n. If there is no such n, return -1.\n\nNote: n may not fit in a 64-bit signed integer.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: k = 1\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: The smallest answer is n = 1, which has length 1.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: k = 2\nOutput: -1\nExplanation: There is no such positive integer n divisible by 2.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: k = 3\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: The smallest answer is n = 111, which has length 3.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= k <= 105\n\n"
