  "description": "There are n uniquely-sized sticks whose lengths are integers from 1 to n. You want to arrange the sticks such that exactly k sticks are visible from the left. A stick is visible from the left if there are no longer sticks to the left of it.\n\n\n\tFor example, if the sticks are arranged [1,3,2,5,4], then the sticks with lengths 1, 3, and 5 are visible from the left.\n\n\nGiven n and k, return the number of such arrangements. Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 109 + 7.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: n = 3, k = 2\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: [1,3,2], [2,3,1], and [2,1,3] are the only arrangements such that exactly 2 sticks are visible.\nThe visible sticks are underlined.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: n = 5, k = 5\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: [1,2,3,4,5] is the only arrangement such that all 5 sticks are visible.\nThe visible sticks are underlined.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: n = 20, k = 11\nOutput: 647427950\nExplanation: There are 647427950 (mod 109 + 7) ways to rearrange the sticks such that exactly 11 sticks are visible.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= n <= 1000\n\t1 <= k <= n\n\n"
