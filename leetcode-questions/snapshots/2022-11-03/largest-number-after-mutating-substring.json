  "description": "You are given a string num, which represents a large integer. You are also given a 0-indexed integer array change of length 10 that maps each digit 0-9 to another digit. More formally, digit d maps to digit change[d].\n\nYou may choose to mutate a single substring of num. To mutate a substring, replace each digit num[i] with the digit it maps to in change (i.e. replace num[i] with change[num[i]]).\n\nReturn a string representing the largest possible integer after mutating (or choosing not to) a single substring of num.\n\nA substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: num = \"132\", change = [9,8,5,0,3,6,4,2,6,8]\nOutput: \"832\"\nExplanation: Replace the substring \"1\":\n- 1 maps to change[1] = 8.\nThus, \"132\" becomes \"832\".\n\"832\" is the largest number that can be created, so return it.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: num = \"021\", change = [9,4,3,5,7,2,1,9,0,6]\nOutput: \"934\"\nExplanation: Replace the substring \"021\":\n- 0 maps to change[0] = 9.\n- 2 maps to change[2] = 3.\n- 1 maps to change[1] = 4.\nThus, \"021\" becomes \"934\".\n\"934\" is the largest number that can be created, so return it.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: num = \"5\", change = [1,4,7,5,3,2,5,6,9,4]\nOutput: \"5\"\nExplanation: \"5\" is already the largest number that can be created, so return it.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= num.length <= 105\n\tnum consists of only digits 0-9.\n\tchange.length == 10\n\t0 <= change[d] <= 9\n\n"
