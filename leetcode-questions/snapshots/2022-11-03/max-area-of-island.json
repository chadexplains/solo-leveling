  "description": "You are given an m x n binary matrix grid. An island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.\n\nThe area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.\n\nReturn the maximum area of an island in grid. If there is no island, return 0.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: grid = [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: The answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: grid = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]\nOutput: 0\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\tm == grid.length\n\tn == grid[i].length\n\t1 <= m, n <= 50\n\tgrid[i][j] is either 0 or 1.\n\n"
