  "description": "You are given an array of integers distance.\n\nYou start at point (0,0) on an X-Y plane and you move distance[0] meters to the north, then distance[1] meters to the west, distance[2] meters to the south, distance[3] meters to the east, and so on. In other words, after each move, your direction changes counter-clockwise.\n\nReturn true if your path crosses itself, and false if it does not.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: distance = [2,1,1,2]\nOutput: true\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: distance = [1,2,3,4]\nOutput: false\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: distance = [1,1,1,1]\nOutput: true\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= distance.length <= 105\n\t1 <= distance[i] <= 105\n\n"
