  "description": "You are given an m x n integer matrix grid.\n\nWe define an hourglass as a part of the matrix with the following form:\n\nReturn the maximum sum of the elements of an hourglass.\n\nNote that an hourglass cannot be rotated and must be entirely contained within the matrix.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: grid = [[6,2,1,3],[4,2,1,5],[9,2,8,7],[4,1,2,9]]\nOutput: 30\nExplanation: The cells shown above represent the hourglass with the maximum sum: 6 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 9 + 2 + 8 = 30.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: grid = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]\nOutput: 35\nExplanation: There is only one hourglass in the matrix, with the sum: 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 35.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\tm == grid.length\n\tn == grid[i].length\n\t3 <= m, n <= 150\n\t0 <= grid[i][j] <= 106\n\n"
