  "description": "Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.\n\nYou must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]\nOutput: 9\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t0 <= nums.length <= 105\n\t-109 <= nums[i] <= 109\n\n"
