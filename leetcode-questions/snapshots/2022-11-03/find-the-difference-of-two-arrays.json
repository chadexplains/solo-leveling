  "description": "Given two 0-indexed integer arrays nums1 and nums2, return a list answer of size 2 where:\n\n\n\tanswer[0] is a list of all distinct integers in nums1 which are not present in nums2.\n\tanswer[1] is a list of all distinct integers in nums2 which are not present in nums1.\n\n\nNote that the integers in the lists may be returned in any order.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums1 = [1,2,3], nums2 = [2,4,6]\nOutput: [[1,3],[4,6]]\nExplanation:\nFor nums1, nums1[1] = 2 is present at index 0 of nums2, whereas nums1[0] = 1 and nums1[2] = 3 are not present in nums2. Therefore, answer[0] = [1,3].\nFor nums2, nums2[0] = 2 is present at index 1 of nums1, whereas nums2[1] = 4 and nums2[2] = 6 are not present in nums2. Therefore, answer[1] = [4,6].\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums1 = [1,2,3,3], nums2 = [1,1,2,2]\nOutput: [[3],[]]\nExplanation:\nFor nums1, nums1[2] and nums1[3] are not present in nums2. Since nums1[2] == nums1[3], their value is only included once and answer[0] = [3].\nEvery integer in nums2 is present in nums1. Therefore, answer[1] = [].\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 1000\n\t-1000 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 1000\n\n"
