  "description": "You have information about n different recipes. You are given a string array recipes and a 2D string array ingredients. The ith recipe has the name recipes[i], and you can create it if you have all the needed ingredients from ingredients[i]. Ingredients to a recipe may need to be created from other recipes, i.e., ingredients[i] may contain a string that is in recipes.\n\nYou are also given a string array supplies containing all the ingredients that you initially have, and you have an infinite supply of all of them.\n\nReturn a list of all the recipes that you can create. You may return the answer in any order.\n\nNote that two recipes may contain each other in their ingredients.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: recipes = [\"bread\"], ingredients = [[\"yeast\",\"flour\"]], supplies = [\"yeast\",\"flour\",\"corn\"]\nOutput: [\"bread\"]\nExplanation:\nWe can create \"bread\" since we have the ingredients \"yeast\" and \"flour\".\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: recipes = [\"bread\",\"sandwich\"], ingredients = [[\"yeast\",\"flour\"],[\"bread\",\"meat\"]], supplies = [\"yeast\",\"flour\",\"meat\"]\nOutput: [\"bread\",\"sandwich\"]\nExplanation:\nWe can create \"bread\" since we have the ingredients \"yeast\" and \"flour\".\nWe can create \"sandwich\" since we have the ingredient \"meat\" and can create the ingredient \"bread\".\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: recipes = [\"bread\",\"sandwich\",\"burger\"], ingredients = [[\"yeast\",\"flour\"],[\"bread\",\"meat\"],[\"sandwich\",\"meat\",\"bread\"]], supplies = [\"yeast\",\"flour\",\"meat\"]\nOutput: [\"bread\",\"sandwich\",\"burger\"]\nExplanation:\nWe can create \"bread\" since we have the ingredients \"yeast\" and \"flour\".\nWe can create \"sandwich\" since we have the ingredient \"meat\" and can create the ingredient \"bread\".\nWe can create \"burger\" since we have the ingredient \"meat\" and can create the ingredients \"bread\" and \"sandwich\".\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\tn == recipes.length == ingredients.length\n\t1 <= n <= 100\n\t1 <= ingredients[i].length, supplies.length <= 100\n\t1 <= recipes[i].length, ingredients[i][j].length, supplies[k].length <= 10\n\trecipes[i], ingredients[i][j], and supplies[k] consist only of lowercase English letters.\n\tAll the values of recipes and supplies combined are unique.\n\tEach ingredients[i] does not contain any duplicate values.\n\n"
