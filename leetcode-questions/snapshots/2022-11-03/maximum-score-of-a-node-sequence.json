  "description": "There is an undirected graph with n nodes, numbered from 0 to n - 1.\n\nYou are given a 0-indexed integer array scores of length n where scores[i] denotes the score of node i. You are also given a 2D integer array edges where edges[i] = [ai, bi] denotes that there exists an undirected edge connecting nodes ai and bi.\n\nA node sequence is valid if it meets the following conditions:\n\n\n\tThere is an edge connecting every pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence.\n\tNo node appears more than once in the sequence.\n\n\nThe score of a node sequence is defined as the sum of the scores of the nodes in the sequence.\n\nReturn the maximum score of a valid node sequence with a length of 4. If no such sequence exists, return -1.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: scores = [5,2,9,8,4], edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[0,2],[1,3],[2,4]]\nOutput: 24\nExplanation: The figure above shows the graph and the chosen node sequence [0,1,2,3].\nThe score of the node sequence is 5 + 2 + 9 + 8 = 24.\nIt can be shown that no other node sequence has a score of more than 24.\nNote that the sequences [3,1,2,0] and [1,0,2,3] are also valid and have a score of 24.\nThe sequence [0,3,2,4] is not valid since no edge connects nodes 0 and 3.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: scores = [9,20,6,4,11,12], edges = [[0,3],[5,3],[2,4],[1,3]]\nOutput: -1\nExplanation: The figure above shows the graph.\nThere are no valid node sequences of length 4, so we return -1.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\tn == scores.length\n\t4 <= n <= 5 * 104\n\t1 <= scores[i] <= 108\n\t0 <= edges.length <= 5 * 104\n\tedges[i].length == 2\n\t0 <= ai, bi <= n - 1\n\tai != bi\n\tThere are no duplicate edges.\n\n"
