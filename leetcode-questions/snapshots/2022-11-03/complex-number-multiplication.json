  "description": "A complex number can be represented as a string on the form \"real+imaginaryi\" where:\n\n\n\treal is the real part and is an integer in the range [-100, 100].\n\timaginary is the imaginary part and is an integer in the range [-100, 100].\n\ti2 == -1.\n\n\nGiven two complex numbers num1 and num2 as strings, return a string of the complex number that represents their multiplications.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: num1 = \"1+1i\", num2 = \"1+1i\"\nOutput: \"0+2i\"\nExplanation: (1 + i) * (1 + i) = 1 + i2 + 2 * i = 2i, and you need convert it to the form of 0+2i.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: num1 = \"1+-1i\", num2 = \"1+-1i\"\nOutput: \"0+-2i\"\nExplanation: (1 - i) * (1 - i) = 1 + i2 - 2 * i = -2i, and you need convert it to the form of 0+-2i.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\tnum1 and num2 are valid complex numbers.\n\n"
