  "description": "You are given an integer array nums where the ith bag contains nums[i] balls. You are also given an integer maxOperations.\n\nYou can perform the following operation at most maxOperations times:\n\n\n\tTake any bag of balls and divide it into two new bags with a positive number of balls.\n\n\t\n\t\tFor example, a bag of 5 balls can become two new bags of 1 and 4 balls, or two new bags of 2 and 3 balls.\n\t\n\t\n\n\nYour penalty is the maximum number of balls in a bag. You want to minimize your penalty after the operations.\n\nReturn the minimum possible penalty after performing the operations.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [9], maxOperations = 2\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: \n- Divide the bag with 9 balls into two bags of sizes 6 and 3. [9] -> [6,3].\n- Divide the bag with 6 balls into two bags of sizes 3 and 3. [6,3] -> [3,3,3].\nThe bag with the most number of balls has 3 balls, so your penalty is 3 and you should return 3.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [2,4,8,2], maxOperations = 4\nOutput: 2\nExplanation:\n- Divide the bag with 8 balls into two bags of sizes 4 and 4. [2,4,8,2] -> [2,4,4,4,2].\n- Divide the bag with 4 balls into two bags of sizes 2 and 2. [2,4,4,4,2] -> [2,2,2,4,4,2].\n- Divide the bag with 4 balls into two bags of sizes 2 and 2. [2,2,2,4,4,2] -> [2,2,2,2,2,4,2].\n- Divide the bag with 4 balls into two bags of sizes 2 and 2. [2,2,2,2,2,4,2] -> [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2].\nThe bag with the most number of balls has 2 balls, so your penalty is 2, and you should return 2.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= nums.length <= 105\n\t1 <= maxOperations, nums[i] <= 109\n\n"
