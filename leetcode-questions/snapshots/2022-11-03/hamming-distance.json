  "description": "The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.\n\nGiven two integers x and y, return the Hamming distance between them.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: x = 1, y = 4\nOutput: 2\nExplanation:\n1   (0 0 0 1)\n4   (0 1 0 0)\n       ↑   ↑\nThe above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: x = 3, y = 1\nOutput: 1\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t0 <= x, y <= 231 - 1\n\n"
