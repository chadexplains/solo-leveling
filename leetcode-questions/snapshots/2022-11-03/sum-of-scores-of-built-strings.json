  "description": "You are building a string s of length n one character at a time, prepending each new character to the front of the string. The strings are labeled from 1 to n, where the string with length i is labeled si.\n\n\n\tFor example, for s = \"abaca\", s1 == \"a\", s2 == \"ca\", s3 == \"aca\", etc.\n\n\nThe score of si is the length of the longest common prefix between si and sn (Note that s == sn).\n\nGiven the final string s, return the sum of the score of every si.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = \"babab\"\nOutput: 9\nExplanation:\nFor s1 == \"b\", the longest common prefix is \"b\" which has a score of 1.\nFor s2 == \"ab\", there is no common prefix so the score is 0.\nFor s3 == \"bab\", the longest common prefix is \"bab\" which has a score of 3.\nFor s4 == \"abab\", there is no common prefix so the score is 0.\nFor s5 == \"babab\", the longest common prefix is \"babab\" which has a score of 5.\nThe sum of the scores is 1 + 0 + 3 + 0 + 5 = 9, so we return 9.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s = \"azbazbzaz\"\nOutput: 14\nExplanation: \nFor s2 == \"az\", the longest common prefix is \"az\" which has a score of 2.\nFor s6 == \"azbzaz\", the longest common prefix is \"azb\" which has a score of 3.\nFor s9 == \"azbazbzaz\", the longest common prefix is \"azbazbzaz\" which has a score of 9.\nFor all other si, the score is 0.\nThe sum of the scores is 2 + 3 + 9 = 14, so we return 14.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= s.length <= 105\n\ts consists of lowercase English letters.\n\n"
