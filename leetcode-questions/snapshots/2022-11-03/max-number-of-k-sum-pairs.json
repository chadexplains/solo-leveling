  "description": "You are given an integer array nums and an integer k.\n\nIn one operation, you can pick two numbers from the array whose sum equals k and remove them from the array.\n\nReturn the maximum number of operations you can perform on the array.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [1,2,3,4], k = 5\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: Starting with nums = [1,2,3,4]:\n- Remove numbers 1 and 4, then nums = [2,3]\n- Remove numbers 2 and 3, then nums = []\nThere are no more pairs that sum up to 5, hence a total of 2 operations.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [3,1,3,4,3], k = 6\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: Starting with nums = [3,1,3,4,3]:\n- Remove the first two 3's, then nums = [1,4,3]\nThere are no more pairs that sum up to 6, hence a total of 1 operation.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= nums.length <= 105\n\t1 <= nums[i] <= 109\n\t1 <= k <= 109\n\n"
