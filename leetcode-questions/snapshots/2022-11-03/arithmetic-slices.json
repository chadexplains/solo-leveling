  "description": "An integer array is called arithmetic if it consists of at least three elements and if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.\n\n\n\tFor example, [1,3,5,7,9], [7,7,7,7], and [3,-1,-5,-9] are arithmetic sequences.\n\n\nGiven an integer array nums, return the number of arithmetic subarrays of nums.\n\nA subarray is a contiguous subsequence of the array.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [1,2,3,4]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: We have 3 arithmetic slices in nums: [1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4] and [1,2,3,4] itself.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [1]\nOutput: 0\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= nums.length <= 5000\n\t-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000\n\n"
