  "description": "There are n seats and n students in a room. You are given an array seats of length n, where seats[i] is the position of the ith seat. You are also given the array students of length n, where students[j] is the position of the jth student.\n\nYou may perform the following move any number of times:\n\n\n\tIncrease or decrease the position of the ith student by 1 (i.e., moving the ith student from position x to x + 1 or x - 1)\n\n\nReturn the minimum number of moves required to move each student to a seat such that no two students are in the same seat.\n\nNote that there may be multiple seats or students in the same position at the beginning.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: seats = [3,1,5], students = [2,7,4]\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: The students are moved as follows:\n- The first student is moved from from position 2 to position 1 using 1 move.\n- The second student is moved from from position 7 to position 5 using 2 moves.\n- The third student is moved from from position 4 to position 3 using 1 move.\nIn total, 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 moves were used.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: seats = [4,1,5,9], students = [1,3,2,6]\nOutput: 7\nExplanation: The students are moved as follows:\n- The first student is not moved.\n- The second student is moved from from position 3 to position 4 using 1 move.\n- The third student is moved from from position 2 to position 5 using 3 moves.\n- The fourth student is moved from from position 6 to position 9 using 3 moves.\nIn total, 0 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 7 moves were used.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: seats = [2,2,6,6], students = [1,3,2,6]\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: Note that there are two seats at position 2 and two seats at position 6.\nThe students are moved as follows:\n- The first student is moved from from position 1 to position 2 using 1 move.\n- The second student is moved from from position 3 to position 6 using 3 moves.\n- The third student is not moved.\n- The fourth student is not moved.\nIn total, 1 + 3 + 0 + 0 = 4 moves were used.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\tn == seats.length == students.length\n\t1 <= n <= 100\n\t1 <= seats[i], students[j] <= 100\n\n"
