  "description": "Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST.\n\nAccording to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: root = [2,1], p = 2, q = 1\nOutput: 2\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\tThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 105].\n\t-109 <= Node.val <= 109\n\tAll Node.val are unique.\n\tp != q\n\tp and q will exist in the BST.\n\n"
