  "description": "You have a grid of size n x 3 and you want to paint each cell of the grid with exactly one of the three colors: Red, Yellow, or Green while making sure that no two adjacent cells have the same color (i.e., no two cells that share vertical or horizontal sides have the same color).\n\nGiven n the number of rows of the grid, return the number of ways you can paint this grid. As the answer may grow large, the answer must be computed modulo 109 + 7.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: n = 1\nOutput: 12\nExplanation: There are 12 possible way to paint the grid as shown.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: n = 5000\nOutput: 30228214\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\tn == grid.length\n\t1 <= n <= 5000\n\n"
