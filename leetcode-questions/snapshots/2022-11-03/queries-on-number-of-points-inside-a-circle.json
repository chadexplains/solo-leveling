  "description": "You are given an array points where points[i] = [xi, yi] is the coordinates of the ith point on a 2D plane. Multiple points can have the same coordinates.\n\nYou are also given an array queries where queries[j] = [xj, yj, rj] describes a circle centered at (xj, yj) with a radius of rj.\n\nFor each query queries[j], compute the number of points inside the jth circle. Points on the border of the circle are considered inside.\n\nReturn an array answer, where answer[j] is the answer to the jth query.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: points = [[1,3],[3,3],[5,3],[2,2]], queries = [[2,3,1],[4,3,1],[1,1,2]]\nOutput: [3,2,2]\nExplanation: The points and circles are shown above.\nqueries[0] is the green circle, queries[1] is the red circle, and queries[2] is the blue circle.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: points = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3],[4,4],[5,5]], queries = [[1,2,2],[2,2,2],[4,3,2],[4,3,3]]\nOutput: [2,3,2,4]\nExplanation: The points and circles are shown above.\nqueries[0] is green, queries[1] is red, queries[2] is blue, and queries[3] is purple.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= points.length <= 500\n\tpoints[i].length == 2\n\t0 <= x​​​​​​i, y​​​​​​i <= 500\n\t1 <= queries.length <= 500\n\tqueries[j].length == 3\n\t0 <= xj, yj <= 500\n\t1 <= rj <= 500\n\tAll coordinates are integers.\n\n\n \nFollow up: Could you find the answer for each query in better complexity than O(n)?\n"
