  "description": "Given two strings s and p, return an array of all the start indices of p's anagrams in s. You may return the answer in any order.\n\nAn Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = \"cbaebabacd\", p = \"abc\"\nOutput: [0,6]\nExplanation:\nThe substring with start index = 0 is \"cba\", which is an anagram of \"abc\".\nThe substring with start index = 6 is \"bac\", which is an anagram of \"abc\".\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s = \"abab\", p = \"ab\"\nOutput: [0,1,2]\nExplanation:\nThe substring with start index = 0 is \"ab\", which is an anagram of \"ab\".\nThe substring with start index = 1 is \"ba\", which is an anagram of \"ab\".\nThe substring with start index = 2 is \"ab\", which is an anagram of \"ab\".\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= s.length, p.length <= 3 * 104\n\ts and p consist of lowercase English letters.\n\n"
