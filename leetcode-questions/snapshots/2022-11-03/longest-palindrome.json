  "description": "Given a string s which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, return the length of the longest palindrome that can be built with those letters.\n\nLetters are case sensitive, for example, \"Aa\" is not considered a palindrome here.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = \"abccccdd\"\nOutput: 7\nExplanation: One longest palindrome that can be built is \"dccaccd\", whose length is 7.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s = \"a\"\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: The longest palindrome that can be built is \"a\", whose length is 1.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= s.length <= 2000\n\ts consists of lowercase and/or uppercase English letters only.\n\n"
