  "description": "You are given two integers n and maxValue, which are used to describe an ideal array.\n\nA 0-indexed integer array arr of length n is considered ideal if the following conditions hold:\n\n\n\tEvery arr[i] is a value from 1 to maxValue, for 0 <= i < n.\n\tEvery arr[i] is divisible by arr[i - 1], for 0 < i < n.\n\n\nReturn the number of distinct ideal arrays of length n. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: n = 2, maxValue = 5\nOutput: 10\nExplanation: The following are the possible ideal arrays:\n- Arrays starting with the value 1 (5 arrays): [1,1], [1,2], [1,3], [1,4], [1,5]\n- Arrays starting with the value 2 (2 arrays): [2,2], [2,4]\n- Arrays starting with the value 3 (1 array): [3,3]\n- Arrays starting with the value 4 (1 array): [4,4]\n- Arrays starting with the value 5 (1 array): [5,5]\nThere are a total of 5 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 10 distinct ideal arrays.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: n = 5, maxValue = 3\nOutput: 11\nExplanation: The following are the possible ideal arrays:\n- Arrays starting with the value 1 (9 arrays): \n   - With no other distinct values (1 array): [1,1,1,1,1] \n   - With 2nd distinct value 2 (4 arrays): [1,1,1,1,2], [1,1,1,2,2], [1,1,2,2,2], [1,2,2,2,2]\n   - With 2nd distinct value 3 (4 arrays): [1,1,1,1,3], [1,1,1,3,3], [1,1,3,3,3], [1,3,3,3,3]\n- Arrays starting with the value 2 (1 array): [2,2,2,2,2]\n- Arrays starting with the value 3 (1 array): [3,3,3,3,3]\nThere are a total of 9 + 1 + 1 = 11 distinct ideal arrays.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t2 <= n <= 104\n\t1 <= maxValue <= 104\n\n"
