  "description": "Consider all the leaves of a binary tree, from left to right order, the values of those leaves form a leaf value sequence.\n\n\n\nFor example, in the given tree above, the leaf value sequence is (6, 7, 4, 9, 8).\n\nTwo binary trees are considered leaf-similar if their leaf value sequence is the same.\n\nReturn true if and only if the two given trees with head nodes root1 and root2 are leaf-similar.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: root1 = [3,5,1,6,2,9,8,null,null,7,4], root2 = [3,5,1,6,7,4,2,null,null,null,null,null,null,9,8]\nOutput: true\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: root1 = [1,2,3], root2 = [1,3,2]\nOutput: false\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\tThe number of nodes in each tree will be in the range [1, 200].\n\tBoth of the given trees will have values in the range [0, 200].\n\n"
