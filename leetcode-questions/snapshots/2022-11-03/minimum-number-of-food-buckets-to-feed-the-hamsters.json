  "description": "You are given a 0-indexed string hamsters where hamsters[i] is either:\n\n\n\t'H' indicating that there is a hamster at index i, or\n\t'.' indicating that index i is empty.\n\n\nYou will add some number of food buckets at the empty indices in order to feed the hamsters. A hamster can be fed if there is at least one food bucket to its left or to its right. More formally, a hamster at index i can be fed if you place a food bucket at index i - 1 and/or at index i + 1.\n\nReturn the minimum number of food buckets you should place at empty indices to feed all the hamsters or -1 if it is impossible to feed all of them.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: hamsters = \"H..H\"\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: We place two food buckets at indices 1 and 2.\nIt can be shown that if we place only one food bucket, one of the hamsters will not be fed.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: hamsters = \".H.H.\"\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: We place one food bucket at index 2.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: hamsters = \".HHH.\"\nOutput: -1\nExplanation: If we place a food bucket at every empty index as shown, the hamster at index 2 will not be able to eat.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= hamsters.length <= 105\n\thamsters[i] is either'H' or '.'.\n\n"
