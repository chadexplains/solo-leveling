  "description": "Given an integer array arr of distinct integers and an integer k.\n\nA game will be played between the first two elements of the array (i.e. arr[0] and arr[1]). In each round of the game, we compare arr[0] with arr[1], the larger integer wins and remains at position 0, and the smaller integer moves to the end of the array. The game ends when an integer wins k consecutive rounds.\n\nReturn the integer which will win the game.\n\nIt is guaranteed that there will be a winner of the game.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: arr = [2,1,3,5,4,6,7], k = 2\nOutput: 5\nExplanation: Let's see the rounds of the game:\nRound |       arr       | winner | win_count\n  1   | [2,1,3,5,4,6,7] | 2      | 1\n  2   | [2,3,5,4,6,7,1] | 3      | 1\n  3   | [3,5,4,6,7,1,2] | 5      | 1\n  4   | [5,4,6,7,1,2,3] | 5      | 2\nSo we can see that 4 rounds will be played and 5 is the winner because it wins 2 consecutive games.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: arr = [3,2,1], k = 10\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: 3 will win the first 10 rounds consecutively.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t2 <= arr.length <= 105\n\t1 <= arr[i] <= 106\n\tarr contains distinct integers.\n\t1 <= k <= 109\n\n"
