  "description": "Given a circular integer array nums (i.e., the next element of nums[nums.length - 1] is nums[0]), return the next greater number for every element in nums.\n\nThe next greater number of a number x is the first greater number to its traversing-order next in the array, which means you could search circularly to find its next greater number. If it doesn't exist, return -1 for this number.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [1,2,1]\nOutput: [2,-1,2]\nExplanation: The first 1's next greater number is 2; \nThe number 2 can't find next greater number. \nThe second 1's next greater number needs to search circularly, which is also 2.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [1,2,3,4,3]\nOutput: [2,3,4,-1,4]\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= nums.length <= 104\n\t-109 <= nums[i] <= 109\n\n"
