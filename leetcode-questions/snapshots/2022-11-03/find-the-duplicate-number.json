  "description": "Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive.\n\nThere is only one repeated number in nums, return this repeated number.\n\nYou must solve the problem without modifying the array nums and uses only constant extra space.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [1,3,4,2,2]\nOutput: 2\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [3,1,3,4,2]\nOutput: 3\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= n <= 105\n\tnums.length == n + 1\n\t1 <= nums[i] <= n\n\tAll the integers in nums appear only once except for precisely one integer which appears two or more times.\n\n\n \nFollow up:\n\n\n\tHow can we prove that at least one duplicate number must exist in nums?\n\tCan you solve the problem in linear runtime complexity?\n\n"
