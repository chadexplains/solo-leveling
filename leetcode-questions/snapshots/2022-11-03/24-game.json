  "description": "You are given an integer array cards of length 4. You have four cards, each containing a number in the range [1, 9]. You should arrange the numbers on these cards in a mathematical expression using the operators ['+', '-', '*', '/'] and the parentheses '(' and ')' to get the value 24.\n\nYou are restricted with the following rules:\n\n\n\tThe division operator '/' represents real division, not integer division.\n\n\t\n\t\tFor example, 4 / (1 - 2 / 3) = 4 / (1 / 3) = 12.\n\t\n\t\n\tEvery operation done is between two numbers. In particular, we cannot use '-' as a unary operator.\n\t\n\t\tFor example, if cards = [1, 1, 1, 1], the expression \"-1 - 1 - 1 - 1\" is not allowed.\n\t\n\t\n\tYou cannot concatenate numbers together\n\t\n\t\tFor example, if cards = [1, 2, 1, 2], the expression \"12 + 12\" is not valid.\n\t\n\t\n\n\nReturn true if you can get such expression that evaluates to 24, and false otherwise.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: cards = [4,1,8,7]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: (8-4) * (7-1) = 24\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: cards = [1,2,1,2]\nOutput: false\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\tcards.length == 4\n\t1 <= cards[i] <= 9\n\n"
