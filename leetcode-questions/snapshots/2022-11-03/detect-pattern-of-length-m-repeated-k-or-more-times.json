  "description": "Given an array of positive integers arr, find a pattern of length m that is repeated k or more times.\n\nA pattern is a subarray (consecutive sub-sequence) that consists of one or more values, repeated multiple times consecutively without overlapping. A pattern is defined by its length and the number of repetitions.\n\nReturn true if there exists a pattern of length m that is repeated k or more times, otherwise return false.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: arr = [1,2,4,4,4,4], m = 1, k = 3\nOutput: true\nExplanation: The pattern (4) of length 1 is repeated 4 consecutive times. Notice that pattern can be repeated k or more times but not less.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: arr = [1,2,1,2,1,1,1,3], m = 2, k = 2\nOutput: true\nExplanation: The pattern (1,2) of length 2 is repeated 2 consecutive times. Another valid pattern (2,1) is also repeated 2 times.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: arr = [1,2,1,2,1,3], m = 2, k = 3\nOutput: false\nExplanation: The pattern (1,2) is of length 2 but is repeated only 2 times. There is no pattern of length 2 that is repeated 3 or more times.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t2 <= arr.length <= 100\n\t1 <= arr[i] <= 100\n\t1 <= m <= 100\n\t2 <= k <= 100\n\n"
