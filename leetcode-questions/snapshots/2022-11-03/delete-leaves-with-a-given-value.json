  "description": "Given a binary tree root and an integer target, delete all the leaf nodes with value target.\n\nNote that once you delete a leaf node with value target, if its parent node becomes a leaf node and has the value target, it should also be deleted (you need to continue doing that until you cannot).\n\n \nExample 1:\n\n\n\nInput: root = [1,2,3,2,null,2,4], target = 2\nOutput: [1,null,3,null,4]\nExplanation: Leaf nodes in green with value (target = 2) are removed (Picture in left). \nAfter removing, new nodes become leaf nodes with value (target = 2) (Picture in center).\n\n\nExample 2:\n\n\n\nInput: root = [1,3,3,3,2], target = 3\nOutput: [1,3,null,null,2]\n\n\nExample 3:\n\n\n\nInput: root = [1,2,null,2,null,2], target = 2\nOutput: [1]\nExplanation: Leaf nodes in green with value (target = 2) are removed at each step.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\tThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 3000].\n\t1 <= Node.val, target <= 1000\n\n"
