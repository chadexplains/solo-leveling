  "description": "A password is said to be strong if it satisfies all the following criteria:\n\n\n\tIt has at least 8 characters.\n\tIt contains at least one lowercase letter.\n\tIt contains at least one uppercase letter.\n\tIt contains at least one digit.\n\tIt contains at least one special character. The special characters are the characters in the following string: \"!@#$%^&*()-+\".\n\tIt does not contain 2 of the same character in adjacent positions (i.e., \"aab\" violates this condition, but \"aba\" does not).\n\n\nGiven a string password, return true if it is a strong password. Otherwise, return false.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: password = \"IloveLe3tcode!\"\nOutput: true\nExplanation: The password meets all the requirements. Therefore, we return true.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: password = \"Me+You--IsMyDream\"\nOutput: false\nExplanation: The password does not contain a digit and also contains 2 of the same character in adjacent positions. Therefore, we return false.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: password = \"1aB!\"\nOutput: false\nExplanation: The password does not meet the length requirement. Therefore, we return false.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= password.length <= 100\n\tpassword consists of letters, digits, and special characters: \"!@#$%^&*()-+\".\n\n"
