  "description": "Given the coordinates of two rectilinear rectangles in a 2D plane, return the total area covered by the two rectangles.\n\nThe first rectangle is defined by its bottom-left corner (ax1, ay1) and its top-right corner (ax2, ay2).\n\nThe second rectangle is defined by its bottom-left corner (bx1, by1) and its top-right corner (bx2, by2).\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: ax1 = -3, ay1 = 0, ax2 = 3, ay2 = 4, bx1 = 0, by1 = -1, bx2 = 9, by2 = 2\nOutput: 45\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: ax1 = -2, ay1 = -2, ax2 = 2, ay2 = 2, bx1 = -2, by1 = -2, bx2 = 2, by2 = 2\nOutput: 16\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t-104 <= ax1 <= ax2 <= 104\n\t-104 <= ay1 <= ay2 <= 104\n\t-104 <= bx1 <= bx2 <= 104\n\t-104 <= by1 <= by2 <= 104\n\n"
