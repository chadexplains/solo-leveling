  "description": "Given an array of strings names of size n. You will create n folders in your file system such that, at the ith minute, you will create a folder with the name names[i].\n\nSince two files cannot have the same name, if you enter a folder name that was previously used, the system will have a suffix addition to its name in the form of (k), where, k is the smallest positive integer such that the obtained name remains unique.\n\nReturn an array of strings of length n where ans[i] is the actual name the system will assign to the ith folder when you create it.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: names = [\"pes\",\"fifa\",\"gta\",\"pes(2019)\"]\nOutput: [\"pes\",\"fifa\",\"gta\",\"pes(2019)\"]\nExplanation: Let's see how the file system creates folder names:\n\"pes\" --> not assigned before, remains \"pes\"\n\"fifa\" --> not assigned before, remains \"fifa\"\n\"gta\" --> not assigned before, remains \"gta\"\n\"pes(2019)\" --> not assigned before, remains \"pes(2019)\"\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: names = [\"gta\",\"gta(1)\",\"gta\",\"avalon\"]\nOutput: [\"gta\",\"gta(1)\",\"gta(2)\",\"avalon\"]\nExplanation: Let's see how the file system creates folder names:\n\"gta\" --> not assigned before, remains \"gta\"\n\"gta(1)\" --> not assigned before, remains \"gta(1)\"\n\"gta\" --> the name is reserved, system adds (k), since \"gta(1)\" is also reserved, systems put k = 2. it becomes \"gta(2)\"\n\"avalon\" --> not assigned before, remains \"avalon\"\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: names = [\"onepiece\",\"onepiece(1)\",\"onepiece(2)\",\"onepiece(3)\",\"onepiece\"]\nOutput: [\"onepiece\",\"onepiece(1)\",\"onepiece(2)\",\"onepiece(3)\",\"onepiece(4)\"]\nExplanation: When the last folder is created, the smallest positive valid k is 4, and it becomes \"onepiece(4)\".\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= names.length <= 5 * 104\n\t1 <= names[i].length <= 20\n\tnames[i] consists of lowercase English letters, digits, and/or round brackets.\n\n"
