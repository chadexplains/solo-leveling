  "description": "A transaction is possibly invalid if:\n\n\n\tthe amount exceeds $1000, or;\n\tif it occurs within (and including) 60 minutes of another transaction with the same name in a different city.\n\n\nYou are given an array of strings transaction where transactions[i] consists of comma-separated values representing the name, time (in minutes), amount, and city of the transaction.\n\nReturn a list of transactions that are possibly invalid. You may return the answer in any order.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: transactions = [\"alice,20,800,mtv\",\"alice,50,100,beijing\"]\nOutput: [\"alice,20,800,mtv\",\"alice,50,100,beijing\"]\nExplanation: The first transaction is invalid because the second transaction occurs within a difference of 60 minutes, have the same name and is in a different city. Similarly the second one is invalid too.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: transactions = [\"alice,20,800,mtv\",\"alice,50,1200,mtv\"]\nOutput: [\"alice,50,1200,mtv\"]\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: transactions = [\"alice,20,800,mtv\",\"bob,50,1200,mtv\"]\nOutput: [\"bob,50,1200,mtv\"]\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\ttransactions.length <= 1000\n\tEach transactions[i] takes the form \"{name},{time},{amount},{city}\"\n\tEach {name} and {city} consist of lowercase English letters, and have lengths between 1 and 10.\n\tEach {time} consist of digits, and represent an integer between 0 and 1000.\n\tEach {amount} consist of digits, and represent an integer between 0 and 2000.\n\n"
