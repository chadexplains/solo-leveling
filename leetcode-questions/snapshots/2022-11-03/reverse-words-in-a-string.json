  "description": "Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.\n\nA word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.\n\nReturn a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.\n\nNote that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = \"the sky is blue\"\nOutput: \"blue is sky the\"\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s = \"  hello world  \"\nOutput: \"world hello\"\nExplanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: s = \"a good   example\"\nOutput: \"example good a\"\nExplanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= s.length <= 104\n\ts contains English letters (upper-case and lower-case), digits, and spaces ' '.\n\tThere is at least one word in s.\n\n\n \nFollow-up: If the string data type is mutable in your language, can you solve it in-place with O(1) extra space?\n"
