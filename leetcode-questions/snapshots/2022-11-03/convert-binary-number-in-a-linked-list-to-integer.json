  "description": "Given head which is a reference node to a singly-linked list. The value of each node in the linked list is either 0 or 1. The linked list holds the binary representation of a number.\n\nReturn the decimal value of the number in the linked list.\n\nThe most significant bit is at the head of the linked list.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: head = [1,0,1]\nOutput: 5\nExplanation: (101) in base 2 = (5) in base 10\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: head = [0]\nOutput: 0\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\tThe Linked List is not empty.\n\tNumber of nodes will not exceed 30.\n\tEach node's value is either 0 or 1.\n\n"
