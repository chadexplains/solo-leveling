  "description": "Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.\n\nTwo binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]\nOutput: true\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]\nOutput: false\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: p = [1,2,1], q = [1,1,2]\nOutput: false\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\tThe number of nodes in both trees is in the range [0, 100].\n\t-104 <= Node.val <= 104\n\n"
