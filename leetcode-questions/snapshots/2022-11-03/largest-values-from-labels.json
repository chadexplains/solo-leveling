  "description": "There is a set of n items. You are given two integer arrays values and labels where the value and the label of the ith element are values[i] and labels[i] respectively. You are also given two integers numWanted and useLimit.\n\nChoose a subset s of the n elements such that:\n\n\n\tThe size of the subset s is less than or equal to numWanted.\n\tThere are at most useLimit items with the same label in s.\n\n\nThe score of a subset is the sum of the values in the subset.\n\nReturn the maximum score of a subset s.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: values = [5,4,3,2,1], labels = [1,1,2,2,3], numWanted = 3, useLimit = 1\nOutput: 9\nExplanation: The subset chosen is the first, third, and fifth items.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: values = [5,4,3,2,1], labels = [1,3,3,3,2], numWanted = 3, useLimit = 2\nOutput: 12\nExplanation: The subset chosen is the first, second, and third items.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: values = [9,8,8,7,6], labels = [0,0,0,1,1], numWanted = 3, useLimit = 1\nOutput: 16\nExplanation: The subset chosen is the first and fourth items.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\tn == values.length == labels.length\n\t1 <= n <= 2 * 104\n\t0 <= values[i], labels[i] <= 2 * 104\n\t1 <= numWanted, useLimit <= n\n\n"
