  "description": "You are given an integer array arr. From some starting index, you can make a series of jumps. The (1st, 3rd, 5th, ...) jumps in the series are called odd-numbered jumps, and the (2nd, 4th, 6th, ...) jumps in the series are called even-numbered jumps. Note that the jumps are numbered, not the indices.\n\nYou may jump forward from index i to index j (with i < j) in the following way:\n\n\n\tDuring odd-numbered jumps (i.e., jumps 1, 3, 5, ...), you jump to the index j such that arr[i] <= arr[j] and arr[j] is the smallest possible value. If there are multiple such indices j, you can only jump to the smallest such index j.\n\tDuring even-numbered jumps (i.e., jumps 2, 4, 6, ...), you jump to the index j such that arr[i] >= arr[j] and arr[j] is the largest possible value. If there are multiple such indices j, you can only jump to the smallest such index j.\n\tIt may be the case that for some index i, there are no legal jumps.\n\n\nA starting index is good if, starting from that index, you can reach the end of the array (index arr.length - 1) by jumping some number of times (possibly 0 or more than once).\n\nReturn the number of good starting indices.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: arr = [10,13,12,14,15]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: \nFrom starting index i = 0, we can make our 1st jump to i = 2 (since arr[2] is the smallest among arr[1], arr[2], arr[3], arr[4] that is greater or equal to arr[0]), then we cannot jump any more.\nFrom starting index i = 1 and i = 2, we can make our 1st jump to i = 3, then we cannot jump any more.\nFrom starting index i = 3, we can make our 1st jump to i = 4, so we have reached the end.\nFrom starting index i = 4, we have reached the end already.\nIn total, there are 2 different starting indices i = 3 and i = 4, where we can reach the end with some number of\njumps.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: arr = [2,3,1,1,4]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: \nFrom starting index i = 0, we make jumps to i = 1, i = 2, i = 3:\nDuring our 1st jump (odd-numbered), we first jump to i = 1 because arr[1] is the smallest value in [arr[1], arr[2], arr[3], arr[4]] that is greater than or equal to arr[0].\nDuring our 2nd jump (even-numbered), we jump from i = 1 to i = 2 because arr[2] is the largest value in [arr[2], arr[3], arr[4]] that is less than or equal to arr[1]. arr[3] is also the largest value, but 2 is a smaller index, so we can only jump to i = 2 and not i = 3\nDuring our 3rd jump (odd-numbered), we jump from i = 2 to i = 3 because arr[3] is the smallest value in [arr[3], arr[4]] that is greater than or equal to arr[2].\nWe can't jump from i = 3 to i = 4, so the starting index i = 0 is not good.\nIn a similar manner, we can deduce that:\nFrom starting index i = 1, we jump to i = 4, so we reach the end.\nFrom starting index i = 2, we jump to i = 3, and then we can't jump anymore.\nFrom starting index i = 3, we jump to i = 4, so we reach the end.\nFrom starting index i = 4, we are already at the end.\nIn total, there are 3 different starting indices i = 1, i = 3, and i = 4, where we can reach the end with some\nnumber of jumps.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: arr = [5,1,3,4,2]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: We can reach the end from starting indices 1, 2, and 4.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= arr.length <= 2 * 104\n\t0 <= arr[i] < 105\n\n"
