  "description": "You are given a string s and an array of strings words. All the strings of words are of the same length.\n\nA concatenated substring in s is a substring that contains all the strings of any permutation of words concatenated.\n\n\n\tFor example, if words = [\"ab\",\"cd\",\"ef\"], then \"abcdef\", \"abefcd\", \"cdabef\", \"cdefab\", \"efabcd\", and \"efcdab\" are all concatenated strings. \"acdbef\" is not a concatenated substring because it is not the concatenation of any permutation of words.\n\n\nReturn the starting indices of all the concatenated substrings in s. You can return the answer in any order.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = \"barfoothefoobarman\", words = [\"foo\",\"bar\"]\nOutput: [0,9]\nExplanation: Since words.length == 2 and words[i].length == 3, the concatenated substring has to be of length 6.\nThe substring starting at 0 is \"barfoo\". It is the concatenation of [\"bar\",\"foo\"] which is a permutation of words.\nThe substring starting at 9 is \"foobar\". It is the concatenation of [\"foo\",\"bar\"] which is a permutation of words.\nThe output order does not matter. Returning [9,0] is fine too.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s = \"wordgoodgoodgoodbestword\", words = [\"word\",\"good\",\"best\",\"word\"]\nOutput: []\nExplanation: Since words.length == 4 and words[i].length == 4, the concatenated substring has to be of length 16.\nThere is no substring of length 16 is s that is equal to the concatenation of any permutation of words.\nWe return an empty array.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: s = \"barfoofoobarthefoobarman\", words = [\"bar\",\"foo\",\"the\"]\nOutput: [6,9,12]\nExplanation: Since words.length == 3 and words[i].length == 3, the concatenated substring has to be of length 9.\nThe substring starting at 6 is \"foobarthe\". It is the concatenation of [\"foo\",\"bar\",\"the\"] which is a permutation of words.\nThe substring starting at 9 is \"barthefoo\". It is the concatenation of [\"bar\",\"the\",\"foo\"] which is a permutation of words.\nThe substring starting at 12 is \"thefoobar\". It is the concatenation of [\"the\",\"foo\",\"bar\"] which is a permutation of words.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= s.length <= 104\n\t1 <= words.length <= 5000\n\t1 <= words[i].length <= 30\n\ts and words[i] consist of lowercase English letters.\n\n"
