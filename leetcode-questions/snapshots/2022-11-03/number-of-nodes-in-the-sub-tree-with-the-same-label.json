  "description": "You are given a tree (i.e. a connected, undirected graph that has no cycles) consisting of n nodes numbered from 0 to n - 1 and exactly n - 1 edges. The root of the tree is the node 0, and each node of the tree has a label which is a lower-case character given in the string labels (i.e. The node with the number i has the label labels[i]).\n\nThe edges array is given on the form edges[i] = [ai, bi], which means there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the tree.\n\nReturn an array of size n where ans[i] is the number of nodes in the subtree of the ith node which have the same label as node i.\n\nA subtree of a tree T is the tree consisting of a node in T and all of its descendant nodes.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,6]], labels = \"abaedcd\"\nOutput: [2,1,1,1,1,1,1]\nExplanation: Node 0 has label 'a' and its sub-tree has node 2 with label 'a' as well, thus the answer is 2. Notice that any node is part of its sub-tree.\nNode 1 has a label 'b'. The sub-tree of node 1 contains nodes 1,4 and 5, as nodes 4 and 5 have different labels than node 1, the answer is just 1 (the node itself).\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: n = 4, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[0,3]], labels = \"bbbb\"\nOutput: [4,2,1,1]\nExplanation: The sub-tree of node 2 contains only node 2, so the answer is 1.\nThe sub-tree of node 3 contains only node 3, so the answer is 1.\nThe sub-tree of node 1 contains nodes 1 and 2, both have label 'b', thus the answer is 2.\nThe sub-tree of node 0 contains nodes 0, 1, 2 and 3, all with label 'b', thus the answer is 4.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: n = 5, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,3],[0,4]], labels = \"aabab\"\nOutput: [3,2,1,1,1]\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= n <= 105\n\tedges.length == n - 1\n\tedges[i].length == 2\n\t0 <= ai, bi < n\n\tai != bi\n\tlabels.length == n\n\tlabels is consisting of only of lowercase English letters.\n\n"
