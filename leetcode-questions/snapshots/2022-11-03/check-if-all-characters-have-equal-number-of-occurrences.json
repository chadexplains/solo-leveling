  "description": "Given a string s, return true if s is a good string, or false otherwise.\n\nA string s is good if all the characters that appear in s have the same number of occurrences (i.e., the same frequency).\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = \"abacbc\"\nOutput: true\nExplanation: The characters that appear in s are 'a', 'b', and 'c'. All characters occur 2 times in s.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s = \"aaabb\"\nOutput: false\nExplanation: The characters that appear in s are 'a' and 'b'.\n'a' occurs 3 times while 'b' occurs 2 times, which is not the same number of times.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= s.length <= 1000\n\ts consists of lowercase English letters.\n\n"
