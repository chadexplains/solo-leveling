  "description": "We have n chips, where the position of the ith chip is position[i].\n\nWe need to move all the chips to the same position. In one step, we can change the position of the ith chip from position[i] to:\n\n\n\tposition[i] + 2 or position[i] - 2 with cost = 0.\n\tposition[i] + 1 or position[i] - 1 with cost = 1.\n\n\nReturn the minimum cost needed to move all the chips to the same position.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: position = [1,2,3]\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: First step: Move the chip at position 3 to position 1 with cost = 0.\nSecond step: Move the chip at position 2 to position 1 with cost = 1.\nTotal cost is 1.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: position = [2,2,2,3,3]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: We can move the two chips at position  3 to position 2. Each move has cost = 1. The total cost = 2.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: position = [1,1000000000]\nOutput: 1\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= position.length <= 100\n\t1 <= position[i] <= 10^9\n\n"
