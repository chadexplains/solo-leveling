  "description": "You are given two arrays of strings that represent two inclusive events that happened on the same day, event1 and event2, where:\n\n\n\tevent1 = [startTime1, endTime1] and\n\tevent2 = [startTime2, endTime2].\n\n\nEvent times are valid 24 hours format in the form of HH:MM.\n\nA conflict happens when two events have some non-empty intersection (i.e., some moment is common to both events).\n\nReturn true if there is a conflict between two events. Otherwise, return false.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: event1 = [\"01:15\",\"02:00\"], event2 = [\"02:00\",\"03:00\"]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: The two events intersect at time 2:00.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: event1 = [\"01:00\",\"02:00\"], event2 = [\"01:20\",\"03:00\"]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: The two events intersect starting from 01:20 to 02:00.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: event1 = [\"10:00\",\"11:00\"], event2 = [\"14:00\",\"15:00\"]\nOutput: false\nExplanation: The two events do not intersect.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\tevnet1.length == event2.length == 2.\n\tevent1[i].length == event2[i].length == 5\n\tstartTime1 <= endTime1\n\tstartTime2 <= endTime2\n\tAll the event times follow the HH:MM format.\n\n"
