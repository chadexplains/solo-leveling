  "description": "You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums of length n.\n\nThe average difference of the index i is the absolute difference between the average of the first i + 1 elements of nums and the average of the last n - i - 1 elements. Both averages should be rounded down to the nearest integer.\n\nReturn the index with the minimum average difference. If there are multiple such indices, return the smallest one.\n\nNote:\n\n\n\tThe absolute difference of two numbers is the absolute value of their difference.\n\tThe average of n elements is the sum of the n elements divided (integer division) by n.\n\tThe average of 0 elements is considered to be 0.\n\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [2,5,3,9,5,3]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation:\n- The average difference of index 0 is: |2 / 1 - (5 + 3 + 9 + 5 + 3) / 5| = |2 / 1 - 25 / 5| = |2 - 5| = 3.\n- The average difference of index 1 is: |(2 + 5) / 2 - (3 + 9 + 5 + 3) / 4| = |7 / 2 - 20 / 4| = |3 - 5| = 2.\n- The average difference of index 2 is: |(2 + 5 + 3) / 3 - (9 + 5 + 3) / 3| = |10 / 3 - 17 / 3| = |3 - 5| = 2.\n- The average difference of index 3 is: |(2 + 5 + 3 + 9) / 4 - (5 + 3) / 2| = |19 / 4 - 8 / 2| = |4 - 4| = 0.\n- The average difference of index 4 is: |(2 + 5 + 3 + 9 + 5) / 5 - 3 / 1| = |24 / 5 - 3 / 1| = |4 - 3| = 1.\n- The average difference of index 5 is: |(2 + 5 + 3 + 9 + 5 + 3) / 6 - 0| = |27 / 6 - 0| = |4 - 0| = 4.\nThe average difference of index 3 is the minimum average difference so return 3.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [0]\nOutput: 0\nExplanation:\nThe only index is 0 so return 0.\nThe average difference of index 0 is: |0 / 1 - 0| = |0 - 0| = 0.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= nums.length <= 105\n\t0 <= nums[i] <= 105\n\n"
