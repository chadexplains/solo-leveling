  "description": "Given an array nums with n integers, your task is to check if it could become non-decreasing by modifying at most one element.\n\nWe define an array is non-decreasing if nums[i] <= nums[i + 1] holds for every i (0-based) such that (0 <= i <= n - 2).\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [4,2,3]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: You could modify the first 4 to 1 to get a non-decreasing array.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [4,2,1]\nOutput: false\nExplanation: You cannot get a non-decreasing array by modifying at most one element.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\tn == nums.length\n\t1 <= n <= 104\n\t-105 <= nums[i] <= 105\n\n"
