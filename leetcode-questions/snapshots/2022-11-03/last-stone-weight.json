  "description": "You are given an array of integers stones where stones[i] is the weight of the ith stone.\n\nWe are playing a game with the stones. On each turn, we choose the heaviest two stones and smash them together. Suppose the heaviest two stones have weights x and y with x <= y. The result of this smash is:\n\n\n\tIf x == y, both stones are destroyed, and\n\tIf x != y, the stone of weight x is destroyed, and the stone of weight y has new weight y - x.\n\n\nAt the end of the game, there is at most one stone left.\n\nReturn the weight of the last remaining stone. If there are no stones left, return 0.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: stones = [2,7,4,1,8,1]\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: \nWe combine 7 and 8 to get 1 so the array converts to [2,4,1,1,1] then,\nwe combine 2 and 4 to get 2 so the array converts to [2,1,1,1] then,\nwe combine 2 and 1 to get 1 so the array converts to [1,1,1] then,\nwe combine 1 and 1 to get 0 so the array converts to [1] then that's the value of the last stone.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: stones = [1]\nOutput: 1\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= stones.length <= 30\n\t1 <= stones[i] <= 1000\n\n"
