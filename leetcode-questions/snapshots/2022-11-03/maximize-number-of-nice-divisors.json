  "description": "You are given a positive integer primeFactors. You are asked to construct a positive integer n that satisfies the following conditions:\n\n\n  The number of prime factors of n (not necessarily distinct) is at most primeFactors.\n  The number of nice divisors of n is maximized. Note that a divisor of n is nice if it is divisible by every prime factor of n. For example, if n = 12, then its prime factors are [2,2,3], then 6 and 12 are nice divisors, while 3 and 4 are not.\n\n\nReturn the number of nice divisors of n. Since that number can be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.\n\nNote that a prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers. The prime factors of a number n is a list of prime numbers such that their product equals n.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: primeFactors = 5\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: 200 is a valid value of n.\nIt has 5 prime factors: [2,2,2,5,5], and it has 6 nice divisors: [10,20,40,50,100,200].\nThere is not other value of n that has at most 5 prime factors and more nice divisors.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: primeFactors = 8\nOutput: 18\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= primeFactors <= 109\n"
