  "description": "Given an equation, represented by words on the left side and the result on the right side.\n\nYou need to check if the equation is solvable under the following rules:\n\n\n\tEach character is decoded as one digit (0 - 9).\n\tNo two characters can map to the same digit.\n\tEach words[i] and result are decoded as one number without leading zeros.\n\tSum of numbers on the left side (words) will equal to the number on the right side (result).\n\n\nReturn true if the equation is solvable, otherwise return false.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: words = [\"SEND\",\"MORE\"], result = \"MONEY\"\nOutput: true\nExplanation: Map 'S'-> 9, 'E'->5, 'N'->6, 'D'->7, 'M'->1, 'O'->0, 'R'->8, 'Y'->'2'\nSuch that: \"SEND\" + \"MORE\" = \"MONEY\" ,  9567 + 1085 = 10652\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: words = [\"SIX\",\"SEVEN\",\"SEVEN\"], result = \"TWENTY\"\nOutput: true\nExplanation: Map 'S'-> 6, 'I'->5, 'X'->0, 'E'->8, 'V'->7, 'N'->2, 'T'->1, 'W'->'3', 'Y'->4\nSuch that: \"SIX\" + \"SEVEN\" + \"SEVEN\" = \"TWENTY\" ,  650 + 68782 + 68782 = 138214\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: words = [\"LEET\",\"CODE\"], result = \"POINT\"\nOutput: false\nExplanation: There is no possible mapping to satisfy the equation, so we return false.\nNote that two different characters cannot map to the same digit.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t2 <= words.length <= 5\n\t1 <= words[i].length, result.length <= 7\n\twords[i], result contain only uppercase English letters.\n\tThe number of different characters used in the expression is at most 10.\n\n"
