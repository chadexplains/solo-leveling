  "description": "You are given two arrays rowSum and colSum of non-negative integers where rowSum[i] is the sum of the elements in the ith row and colSum[j] is the sum of the elements of the jth column of a 2D matrix. In other words, you do not know the elements of the matrix, but you do know the sums of each row and column.\n\nFind any matrix of non-negative integers of size rowSum.length x colSum.length that satisfies the rowSum and colSum requirements.\n\nReturn a 2D array representing any matrix that fulfills the requirements. It's guaranteed that at least one matrix that fulfills the requirements exists.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: rowSum = [3,8], colSum = [4,7]\nOutput: [[3,0],\n         [1,7]]\nExplanation: \n0th row: 3 + 0 = 3 == rowSum[0]\n1st row: 1 + 7 = 8 == rowSum[1]\n0th column: 3 + 1 = 4 == colSum[0]\n1st column: 0 + 7 = 7 == colSum[1]\nThe row and column sums match, and all matrix elements are non-negative.\nAnother possible matrix is: [[1,2],\n                             [3,5]]\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: rowSum = [5,7,10], colSum = [8,6,8]\nOutput: [[0,5,0],\n         [6,1,0],\n         [2,0,8]]\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= rowSum.length, colSum.length <= 500\n\t0 <= rowSum[i], colSum[i] <= 108\n\tsum(rows) == sum(columns)\n\n"
