  "description": "Given a string s and an integer k, return the length of the longest substring of s such that the frequency of each character in this substring is greater than or equal to k.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = \"aaabb\", k = 3\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: The longest substring is \"aaa\", as 'a' is repeated 3 times.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s = \"ababbc\", k = 2\nOutput: 5\nExplanation: The longest substring is \"ababb\", as 'a' is repeated 2 times and 'b' is repeated 3 times.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= s.length <= 104\n\ts consists of only lowercase English letters.\n\t1 <= k <= 105\n\n"
