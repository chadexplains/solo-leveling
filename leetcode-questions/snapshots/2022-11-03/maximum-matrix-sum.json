  "description": "You are given an n x n integer matrix. You can do the following operation any number of times:\n\n\n\tChoose any two adjacent elements of matrix and multiply each of them by -1.\n\n\nTwo elements are considered adjacent if and only if they share a border.\n\nYour goal is to maximize the summation of the matrix's elements. Return the maximum sum of the matrix's elements using the operation mentioned above.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: matrix = [[1,-1],[-1,1]]\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: We can follow the following steps to reach sum equals 4:\n- Multiply the 2 elements in the first row by -1.\n- Multiply the 2 elements in the first column by -1.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: matrix = [[1,2,3],[-1,-2,-3],[1,2,3]]\nOutput: 16\nExplanation: We can follow the following step to reach sum equals 16:\n- Multiply the 2 last elements in the second row by -1.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\tn == matrix.length == matrix[i].length\n\t2 <= n <= 250\n\t-105 <= matrix[i][j] <= 105\n\n"
