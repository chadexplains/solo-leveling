  "description": "Find all valid combinations of k numbers that sum up to n such that the following conditions are true:\n\n\n\tOnly numbers 1 through 9 are used.\n\tEach number is used at most once.\n\n\nReturn a list of all possible valid combinations. The list must not contain the same combination twice, and the combinations may be returned in any order.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: k = 3, n = 7\nOutput: [[1,2,4]]\nExplanation:\n1 + 2 + 4 = 7\nThere are no other valid combinations.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: k = 3, n = 9\nOutput: [[1,2,6],[1,3,5],[2,3,4]]\nExplanation:\n1 + 2 + 6 = 9\n1 + 3 + 5 = 9\n2 + 3 + 4 = 9\nThere are no other valid combinations.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: k = 4, n = 1\nOutput: []\nExplanation: There are no valid combinations.\nUsing 4 different numbers in the range [1,9], the smallest sum we can get is 1+2+3+4 = 10 and since 10 > 1, there are no valid combination.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t2 <= k <= 9\n\t1 <= n <= 60\n\n"
