  "description": "We are playing the Guessing Game. The game will work as follows:\n\n\n\tI pick a number between 1 and n.\n\tYou guess a number.\n\tIf you guess the right number, you win the game.\n\tIf you guess the wrong number, then I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower, and you will continue guessing.\n\tEvery time you guess a wrong number x, you will pay x dollars. If you run out of money, you lose the game.\n\n\nGiven a particular n, return the minimum amount of money you need to guarantee a win regardless of what number I pick.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: n = 10\nOutput: 16\nExplanation: The winning strategy is as follows:\n- The range is [1,10]. Guess 7.\n    - If this is my number, your total is $0. Otherwise, you pay $7.\n    - If my number is higher, the range is [8,10]. Guess 9.\n        - If this is my number, your total is $7. Otherwise, you pay $9.\n        - If my number is higher, it must be 10. Guess 10. Your total is $7 + $9 = $16.\n        - If my number is lower, it must be 8. Guess 8. Your total is $7 + $9 = $16.\n    - If my number is lower, the range is [1,6]. Guess 3.\n        - If this is my number, your total is $7. Otherwise, you pay $3.\n        - If my number is higher, the range is [4,6]. Guess 5.\n            - If this is my number, your total is $7 + $3 = $10. Otherwise, you pay $5.\n            - If my number is higher, it must be 6. Guess 6. Your total is $7 + $3 + $5 = $15.\n            - If my number is lower, it must be 4. Guess 4. Your total is $7 + $3 + $5 = $15.\n        - If my number is lower, the range is [1,2]. Guess 1.\n            - If this is my number, your total is $7 + $3 = $10. Otherwise, you pay $1.\n            - If my number is higher, it must be 2. Guess 2. Your total is $7 + $3 + $1 = $11.\nThe worst case in all these scenarios is that you pay $16. Hence, you only need $16 to guarantee a win.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: n = 1\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: There is only one possible number, so you can guess 1 and not have to pay anything.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: n = 2\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: There are two possible numbers, 1 and 2.\n- Guess 1.\n    - If this is my number, your total is $0. Otherwise, you pay $1.\n    - If my number is higher, it must be 2. Guess 2. Your total is $1.\nThe worst case is that you pay $1.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= n <= 200\n\n"
