  "description": "Given an array of integers preorder, which represents the preorder traversal of a BST (i.e., binary search tree), construct the tree and return its root.\n\nIt is guaranteed that there is always possible to find a binary search tree with the given requirements for the given test cases.\n\nA binary search tree is a binary tree where for every node, any descendant of Node.left has a value strictly less than Node.val, and any descendant of Node.right has a value strictly greater than Node.val.\n\nA preorder traversal of a binary tree displays the value of the node first, then traverses Node.left, then traverses Node.right.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: preorder = [8,5,1,7,10,12]\nOutput: [8,5,10,1,7,null,12]\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: preorder = [1,3]\nOutput: [1,null,3]\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= preorder.length <= 100\n\t1 <= preorder[i] <= 1000\n\tAll the values of preorder are unique.\n\n"
