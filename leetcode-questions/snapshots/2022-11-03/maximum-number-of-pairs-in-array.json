  "description": "You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums. In one operation, you may do the following:\n\n\n\tChoose two integers in nums that are equal.\n\tRemove both integers from nums, forming a pair.\n\n\nThe operation is done on nums as many times as possible.\n\nReturn a 0-indexed integer array answer of size 2 where answer[0] is the number of pairs that are formed and answer[1] is the number of leftover integers in nums after doing the operation as many times as possible.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [1,3,2,1,3,2,2]\nOutput: [3,1]\nExplanation:\nForm a pair with nums[0] and nums[3] and remove them from nums. Now, nums = [3,2,3,2,2].\nForm a pair with nums[0] and nums[2] and remove them from nums. Now, nums = [2,2,2].\nForm a pair with nums[0] and nums[1] and remove them from nums. Now, nums = [2].\nNo more pairs can be formed. A total of 3 pairs have been formed, and there is 1 number leftover in nums.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [1,1]\nOutput: [1,0]\nExplanation: Form a pair with nums[0] and nums[1] and remove them from nums. Now, nums = [].\nNo more pairs can be formed. A total of 1 pair has been formed, and there are 0 numbers leftover in nums.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: nums = [0]\nOutput: [0,1]\nExplanation: No pairs can be formed, and there is 1 number leftover in nums.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= nums.length <= 100\n\t0 <= nums[i] <= 100\n\n"
