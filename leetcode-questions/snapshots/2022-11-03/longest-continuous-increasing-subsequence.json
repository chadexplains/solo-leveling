  "description": "Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest continuous increasing subsequence (i.e. subarray). The subsequence must be strictly increasing.\n\nA continuous increasing subsequence is defined by two indices l and r (l < r) such that it is [nums[l], nums[l + 1], ..., nums[r - 1], nums[r]] and for each l <= i < r, nums[i] < nums[i + 1].\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [1,3,5,4,7]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [1,3,5] with length 3.\nEven though [1,3,5,7] is an increasing subsequence, it is not continuous as elements 5 and 7 are separated by element\n4.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [2,2,2,2,2]\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [2] with length 1. Note that it must be strictly\nincreasing.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= nums.length <= 104\n\t-109 <= nums[i] <= 109\n\n"
