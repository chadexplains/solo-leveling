  "description": "A string is considered beautiful if it satisfies the following conditions:\n\n\n\tEach of the 5 English vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') must appear at least once in it.\n\tThe letters must be sorted in alphabetical order (i.e. all 'a's before 'e's, all 'e's before 'i's, etc.).\n\n\nFor example, strings \"aeiou\" and \"aaaaaaeiiiioou\" are considered beautiful, but \"uaeio\", \"aeoiu\", and \"aaaeeeooo\" are not beautiful.\n\nGiven a string word consisting of English vowels, return the length of the longest beautiful substring of word. If no such substring exists, return 0.\n\nA substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: word = \"aeiaaioaaaaeiiiiouuuooaauuaeiu\"\nOutput: 13\nExplanation: The longest beautiful substring in word is \"aaaaeiiiiouuu\" of length 13.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: word = \"aeeeiiiioooauuuaeiou\"\nOutput: 5\nExplanation: The longest beautiful substring in word is \"aeiou\" of length 5.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: word = \"a\"\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: There is no beautiful substring, so return 0.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= word.length <= 5 * 105\n\tword consists of characters 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u'.\n\n"
