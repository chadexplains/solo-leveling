  "description": "You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The most significant digit comes first and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.\n\nYou may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: l1 = [7,2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]\nOutput: [7,8,0,7]\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]\nOutput: [8,0,7]\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]\nOutput: [0]\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\tThe number of nodes in each linked list is in the range [1, 100].\n\t0 <= Node.val <= 9\n\tIt is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.\n\n\n \nFollow up: Could you solve it without reversing the input lists?\n"
