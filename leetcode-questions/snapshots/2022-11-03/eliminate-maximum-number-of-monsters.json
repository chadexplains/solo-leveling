  "description": "You are playing a video game where you are defending your city from a group of n monsters. You are given a 0-indexed integer array dist of size n, where dist[i] is the initial distance in kilometers of the ith monster from the city.\n\nThe monsters walk toward the city at a constant speed. The speed of each monster is given to you in an integer array speed of size n, where speed[i] is the speed of the ith monster in kilometers per minute.\n\nYou have a weapon that, once fully charged, can eliminate a single monster. However, the weapon takes one minute to charge.The weapon is fully charged at the very start.\n\nYou lose when any monster reaches your city. If a monster reaches the city at the exact moment the weapon is fully charged, it counts as a loss, and the game ends before you can use your weapon.\n\nReturn the maximum number of monsters that you can eliminate before you lose, or n if you can eliminate all the monsters before they reach the city.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: dist = [1,3,4], speed = [1,1,1]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation:\nIn the beginning, the distances of the monsters are [1,3,4]. You eliminate the first monster.\nAfter a minute, the distances of the monsters are [X,2,3]. You eliminate the second monster.\nAfter a minute, the distances of the monsters are [X,X,2]. You eliminate the thrid monster.\nAll 3 monsters can be eliminated.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: dist = [1,1,2,3], speed = [1,1,1,1]\nOutput: 1\nExplanation:\nIn the beginning, the distances of the monsters are [1,1,2,3]. You eliminate the first monster.\nAfter a minute, the distances of the monsters are [X,0,1,2], so you lose.\nYou can only eliminate 1 monster.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: dist = [3,2,4], speed = [5,3,2]\nOutput: 1\nExplanation:\nIn the beginning, the distances of the monsters are [3,2,4]. You eliminate the first monster.\nAfter a minute, the distances of the monsters are [X,0,2], so you lose.\nYou can only eliminate 1 monster.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\tn == dist.length == speed.length\n\t1 <= n <= 105\n\t1 <= dist[i], speed[i] <= 105\n\n"
