  "description": "You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums, where nums[i] represents the score of the ith student. You are also given an integer k.\n\nPick the scores of any k students from the array so that the difference between the highest and the lowest of the k scores is minimized.\n\nReturn the minimum possible difference.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [90], k = 1\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: There is one way to pick score(s) of one student:\n- [90]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 90 - 90 = 0.\nThe minimum possible difference is 0.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [9,4,1,7], k = 2\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: There are six ways to pick score(s) of two students:\n- [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 9 - 4 = 5.\n- [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 9 - 1 = 8.\n- [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 9 - 7 = 2.\n- [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 4 - 1 = 3.\n- [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 7 - 4 = 3.\n- [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 7 - 1 = 6.\nThe minimum possible difference is 2.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= k <= nums.length <= 1000\n\t0 <= nums[i] <= 105\n\n"
