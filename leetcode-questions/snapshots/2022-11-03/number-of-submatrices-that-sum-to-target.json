  "description": "Given a matrix and a target, return the number of non-empty submatrices that sum to target.\n\nA submatrix x1, y1, x2, y2 is the set of all cells matrix[x][y] with x1 <= x <= x2 and y1 <= y <= y2.\n\nTwo submatrices (x1, y1, x2, y2) and (x1', y1', x2', y2') are different if they have some coordinate that is different: for example, if x1 != x1'.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: matrix = [[0,1,0],[1,1,1],[0,1,0]], target = 0\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: The four 1x1 submatrices that only contain 0.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: matrix = [[1,-1],[-1,1]], target = 0\nOutput: 5\nExplanation: The two 1x2 submatrices, plus the two 2x1 submatrices, plus the 2x2 submatrix.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: matrix = [[904]], target = 0\nOutput: 0\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= matrix.length <= 100\n\t1 <= matrix[0].length <= 100\n\t-1000 <= matrix[i] <= 1000\n\t-10^8 <= target <= 10^8\n\n"
