  "description": "You are given an integer n, the number of teams in a tournament that has strange rules:\n\n\n\tIf the current number of teams is even, each team gets paired with another team. A total of n / 2 matches are played, and n / 2 teams advance to the next round.\n\tIf the current number of teams is odd, one team randomly advances in the tournament, and the rest gets paired. A total of (n - 1) / 2 matches are played, and (n - 1) / 2 + 1 teams advance to the next round.\n\n\nReturn the number of matches played in the tournament until a winner is decided.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: n = 7\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: Details of the tournament: \n- 1st Round: Teams = 7, Matches = 3, and 4 teams advance.\n- 2nd Round: Teams = 4, Matches = 2, and 2 teams advance.\n- 3rd Round: Teams = 2, Matches = 1, and 1 team is declared the winner.\nTotal number of matches = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: n = 14\nOutput: 13\nExplanation: Details of the tournament:\n- 1st Round: Teams = 14, Matches = 7, and 7 teams advance.\n- 2nd Round: Teams = 7, Matches = 3, and 4 teams advance.\n- 3rd Round: Teams = 4, Matches = 2, and 2 teams advance.\n- 4th Round: Teams = 2, Matches = 1, and 1 team is declared the winner.\nTotal number of matches = 7 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 13.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= n <= 200\n\n"
