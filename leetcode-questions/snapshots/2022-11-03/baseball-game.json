  "description": "You are keeping the scores for a baseball game with strange rules. At the beginning of the game, you start with an empty record.\n\nYou are given a list of strings operations, where operations[i] is the ith operation you must apply to the record and is one of the following:\n\n\n\tAn integer x.\n\n\t\n\t\tRecord a new score of x.\n\t\n\t\n\t'+'.\n\t\n\t\tRecord a new score that is the sum of the previous two scores.\n\t\n\t\n\t'D'.\n\t\n\t\tRecord a new score that is the double of the previous score.\n\t\n\t\n\t'C'.\n\t\n\t\tInvalidate the previous score, removing it from the record.\n\t\n\t\n\n\nReturn the sum of all the scores on the record after applying all the operations.\n\nThe test cases are generated such that the answer and all intermediate calculations fit in a 32-bit integer and that all operations are valid.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: ops = [\"5\",\"2\",\"C\",\"D\",\"+\"]\nOutput: 30\nExplanation:\n\"5\" - Add 5 to the record, record is now [5].\n\"2\" - Add 2 to the record, record is now [5, 2].\n\"C\" - Invalidate and remove the previous score, record is now [5].\n\"D\" - Add 2 * 5 = 10 to the record, record is now [5, 10].\n\"+\" - Add 5 + 10 = 15 to the record, record is now [5, 10, 15].\nThe total sum is 5 + 10 + 15 = 30.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: ops = [\"5\",\"-2\",\"4\",\"C\",\"D\",\"9\",\"+\",\"+\"]\nOutput: 27\nExplanation:\n\"5\" - Add 5 to the record, record is now [5].\n\"-2\" - Add -2 to the record, record is now [5, -2].\n\"4\" - Add 4 to the record, record is now [5, -2, 4].\n\"C\" - Invalidate and remove the previous score, record is now [5, -2].\n\"D\" - Add 2 * -2 = -4 to the record, record is now [5, -2, -4].\n\"9\" - Add 9 to the record, record is now [5, -2, -4, 9].\n\"+\" - Add -4 + 9 = 5 to the record, record is now [5, -2, -4, 9, 5].\n\"+\" - Add 9 + 5 = 14 to the record, record is now [5, -2, -4, 9, 5, 14].\nThe total sum is 5 + -2 + -4 + 9 + 5 + 14 = 27.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: ops = [\"1\",\"C\"]\nOutput: 0\nExplanation:\n\"1\" - Add 1 to the record, record is now [1].\n\"C\" - Invalidate and remove the previous score, record is now [].\nSince the record is empty, the total sum is 0.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= operations.length <= 1000\n\toperations[i] is \"C\", \"D\", \"+\", or a string representing an integer in the range [-3 * 104, 3 * 104].\n\tFor operation \"+\", there will always be at least two previous scores on the record.\n\tFor operations \"C\" and \"D\", there will always be at least one previous score on the record.\n\n"
