  "description": "In a town, there are n people labeled from 1 to n. There is a rumor that one of these people is secretly the town judge.\n\nIf the town judge exists, then:\n\n\n\tThe town judge trusts nobody.\n\tEverybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town judge.\n\tThere is exactly one person that satisfies properties 1 and 2.\n\n\nYou are given an array trust where trust[i] = [ai, bi] representing that the person labeled ai trusts the person labeled bi.\n\nReturn the label of the town judge if the town judge exists and can be identified, or return -1 otherwise.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: n = 2, trust = [[1,2]]\nOutput: 2\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: n = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3]]\nOutput: 3\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: n = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3],[3,1]]\nOutput: -1\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= n <= 1000\n\t0 <= trust.length <= 104\n\ttrust[i].length == 2\n\tAll the pairs of trust are unique.\n\tai != bi\n\t1 <= ai, bi <= n\n\n"
