  "description": "You are given an array points containing the coordinates of points on a 2D plane, sorted by the x-values, where points[i] = [xi, yi] such that xi < xj for all 1 <= i < j <= points.length. You are also given an integer k.\n\nReturn the maximum value of the equation yi + yj + |xi - xj| where |xi - xj| <= k and 1 <= i < j <= points.length.\n\nIt is guaranteed that there exists at least one pair of points that satisfy the constraint |xi - xj| <= k.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: points = [[1,3],[2,0],[5,10],[6,-10]], k = 1\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: The first two points satisfy the condition |xi - xj| <= 1 and if we calculate the equation we get 3 + 0 + |1 - 2| = 4. Third and fourth points also satisfy the condition and give a value of 10 + -10 + |5 - 6| = 1.\nNo other pairs satisfy the condition, so we return the max of 4 and 1.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: points = [[0,0],[3,0],[9,2]], k = 3\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: Only the first two points have an absolute difference of 3 or less in the x-values, and give the value of 0 + 0 + |0 - 3| = 3.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t2 <= points.length <= 105\n\tpoints[i].length == 2\n\t-108 <= xi, yi <= 108\n\t0 <= k <= 2 * 108\n\txi < xj for all 1 <= i < j <= points.length\n\txi form a strictly increasing sequence.\n\n"
