  "description": "You are given a string s and a robot that currently holds an empty string t. Apply one of the following operations until s and t are both empty:\n\n\n\tRemove the first character of a string s and give it to the robot. The robot will append this character to the string t.\n\tRemove the last character of a string t and give it to the robot. The robot will write this character on paper.\n\n\nReturn the lexicographically smallest string that can be written on the paper.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = \"zza\"\nOutput: \"azz\"\nExplanation: Let p denote the written string.\nInitially p=\"\", s=\"zza\", t=\"\".\nPerform first operation three times p=\"\", s=\"\", t=\"zza\".\nPerform second operation three times p=\"azz\", s=\"\", t=\"\".\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s = \"bac\"\nOutput: \"abc\"\nExplanation: Let p denote the written string.\nPerform first operation twice p=\"\", s=\"c\", t=\"ba\". \nPerform second operation twice p=\"ab\", s=\"c\", t=\"\". \nPerform first operation p=\"ab\", s=\"\", t=\"c\". \nPerform second operation p=\"abc\", s=\"\", t=\"\".\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: s = \"bdda\"\nOutput: \"addb\"\nExplanation: Let p denote the written string.\nInitially p=\"\", s=\"bdda\", t=\"\".\nPerform first operation four times p=\"\", s=\"\", t=\"bdda\".\nPerform second operation four times p=\"addb\", s=\"\", t=\"\".\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= s.length <= 105\n\ts consists of only English lowercase letters.\n\n"
