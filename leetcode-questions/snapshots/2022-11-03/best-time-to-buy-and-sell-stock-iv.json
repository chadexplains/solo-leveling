  "description": "You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day, and an integer k.\n\nFind the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete at most k transactions.\n\nNote: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: k = 2, prices = [2,4,1]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 2) and sell on day 2 (price = 4), profit = 4-2 = 2.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: k = 2, prices = [3,2,6,5,0,3]\nOutput: 7\nExplanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 2) and sell on day 3 (price = 6), profit = 6-2 = 4. Then buy on day 5 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= k <= 100\n\t1 <= prices.length <= 1000\n\t0 <= prices[i] <= 1000\n\n"
