  "description": "Given an array nums, return true if the array was originally sorted in non-decreasing order, then rotated some number of positions (including zero). Otherwise, return false.\n\nThere may be duplicates in the original array.\n\nNote: An array A rotated by x positions results in an array B of the same length such that A[i] == B[(i+x) % A.length], where % is the modulo operation.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: [1,2,3,4,5] is the original sorted array.\nYou can rotate the array by x = 3 positions to begin on the the element of value 3: [3,4,5,1,2].\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [2,1,3,4]\nOutput: false\nExplanation: There is no sorted array once rotated that can make nums.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: nums = [1,2,3]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: [1,2,3] is the original sorted array.\nYou can rotate the array by x = 0 positions (i.e. no rotation) to make nums.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= nums.length <= 100\n\t1 <= nums[i] <= 100\n\n"
