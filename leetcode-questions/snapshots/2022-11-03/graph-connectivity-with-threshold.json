  "description": "We have n cities labeled from 1 to n. Two different cities with labels x and y are directly connected by a bidirectional road if and only if x and y share a common divisor strictly greater than some threshold. More formally, cities with labels x and y have a road between them if there exists an integer z such that all of the following are true:\n\n\n\tx % z == 0,\n\ty % z == 0, and\n\tz > threshold.\n\n\nGiven the two integers, n and threshold, and an array of queries, you must determine for each queries[i] = [ai, bi] if cities ai and bi are connected directly or indirectly. (i.e. there is some path between them).\n\nReturn an array answer, where answer.length == queries.length and answer[i] is true if for the ith query, there is a path between ai and bi, or answer[i] is false if there is no path.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: n = 6, threshold = 2, queries = [[1,4],[2,5],[3,6]]\nOutput: [false,false,true]\nExplanation: The divisors for each number:\n1:   1\n2:   1, 2\n3:   1, 3\n4:   1, 2, 4\n5:   1, 5\n6:   1, 2, 3, 6\nUsing the underlined divisors above the threshold, only cities 3 and 6 share a common divisor, so they are the\nonly ones directly connected. The result of each query:\n[1,4]   1 is not connected to 4\n[2,5]   2 is not connected to 5\n[3,6]   3 is connected to 6 through path 3--6\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: n = 6, threshold = 0, queries = [[4,5],[3,4],[3,2],[2,6],[1,3]]\nOutput: [true,true,true,true,true]\nExplanation: The divisors for each number are the same as the previous example. However, since the threshold is 0,\nall divisors can be used. Since all numbers share 1 as a divisor, all cities are connected.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: n = 5, threshold = 1, queries = [[4,5],[4,5],[3,2],[2,3],[3,4]]\nOutput: [false,false,false,false,false]\nExplanation: Only cities 2 and 4 share a common divisor 2 which is strictly greater than the threshold 1, so they are the only ones directly connected.\nPlease notice that there can be multiple queries for the same pair of nodes [x, y], and that the query [x, y] is equivalent to the query [y, x].\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t2 <= n <= 104\n\t0 <= threshold <= n\n\t1 <= queries.length <= 105\n\tqueries[i].length == 2\n\t1 <= ai, bi <= cities\n\tai != bi\n\n"
