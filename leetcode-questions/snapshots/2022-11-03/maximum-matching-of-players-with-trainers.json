  "description": "You are given a 0-indexed integer array players, where players[i] represents the ability of the ith player. You are also given a 0-indexed integer array trainers, where trainers[j] represents the training capacity of the jth trainer.\n\nThe ith player can match with the jth trainer if the player's ability is less than or equal to the trainer's training capacity. Additionally, the ith player can be matched with at most one trainer, and the jth trainer can be matched with at most one player.\n\nReturn the maximum number of matchings between players and trainers that satisfy these conditions.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: players = [4,7,9], trainers = [8,2,5,8]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation:\nOne of the ways we can form two matchings is as follows:\n- players[0] can be matched with trainers[0] since 4 <= 8.\n- players[1] can be matched with trainers[3] since 7 <= 8.\nIt can be proven that 2 is the maximum number of matchings that can be formed.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: players = [1,1,1], trainers = [10]\nOutput: 1\nExplanation:\nThe trainer can be matched with any of the 3 players.\nEach player can only be matched with one trainer, so the maximum answer is 1.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= players.length, trainers.length <= 105\n\t1 <= players[i], trainers[j] <= 109\n\n"
