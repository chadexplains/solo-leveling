  "description": "Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]\nOutput: 9\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\tn == height.length\n\t1 <= n <= 2 * 104\n\t0 <= height[i] <= 105\n\n"
