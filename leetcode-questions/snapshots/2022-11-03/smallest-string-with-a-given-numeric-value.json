  "description": "The numeric value of a lowercase character is defined as its position (1-indexed) in the alphabet, so the numeric value of a is 1, the numeric value of b is 2, the numeric value of c is 3, and so on.\n\nThe numeric value of a string consisting of lowercase characters is defined as the sum of its characters' numeric values. For example, the numeric value of the string \"abe\" is equal to 1 + 2 + 5 = 8.\n\nYou are given two integers n and k. Return the lexicographically smallest string with length equal to n and numeric value equal to k.\n\nNote that a string x is lexicographically smaller than string y if x comes before y in dictionary order, that is, either x is a prefix of y, or if i is the first position such that x[i] != y[i], then x[i] comes before y[i] in alphabetic order.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: n = 3, k = 27\nOutput: \"aay\"\nExplanation: The numeric value of the string is 1 + 1 + 25 = 27, and it is the smallest string with such a value and length equal to 3.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: n = 5, k = 73\nOutput: \"aaszz\"\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= n <= 105\n\tn <= k <= 26 * n\n\n"
