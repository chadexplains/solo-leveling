  "description": "Given a 0-indexed integer array nums of length n and an integer k, return the number of pairs (i, j) where 0 <= i < j < n, such that nums[i] == nums[j] and (i * j) is divisible by k.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [3,1,2,2,2,1,3], k = 2\nOutput: 4\nExplanation:\nThere are 4 pairs that meet all the requirements:\n- nums[0] == nums[6], and 0 * 6 == 0, which is divisible by 2.\n- nums[2] == nums[3], and 2 * 3 == 6, which is divisible by 2.\n- nums[2] == nums[4], and 2 * 4 == 8, which is divisible by 2.\n- nums[3] == nums[4], and 3 * 4 == 12, which is divisible by 2.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [1,2,3,4], k = 1\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: Since no value in nums is repeated, there are no pairs (i,j) that meet all the requirements.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= nums.length <= 100\n\t1 <= nums[i], k <= 100\n\n"
