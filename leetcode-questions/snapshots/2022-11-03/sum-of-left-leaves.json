  "description": "Given the root of a binary tree, return the sum of all left leaves.\n\nA leaf is a node with no children. A left leaf is a leaf that is the left child of another node.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]\nOutput: 24\nExplanation: There are two left leaves in the binary tree, with values 9 and 15 respectively.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: root = [1]\nOutput: 0\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\tThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000].\n\t-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000\n\n"
