  "description": "Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].\n\nThe product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.\n\nYou must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.\n\n \nExample 1:\nInput: nums = [1,2,3,4]\nOutput: [24,12,8,6]\nExample 2:\nInput: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]\nOutput: [0,0,9,0,0]\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t2 <= nums.length <= 105\n\t-30 <= nums[i] <= 30\n\tThe product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.\n\n\n \nFollow up: Can you solve the problem in O(1) extra space complexity? (The output array does not count as extra space for space complexity analysis.)\n"
