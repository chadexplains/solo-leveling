  "description": "You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of the ith item in a shop.\n\nThere is a special discount for items in the shop. If you buy the ith item, then you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[j] where j is the minimum index such that j > i and prices[j] <= prices[i]. Otherwise, you will not receive any discount at all.\n\nReturn an integer array answer where answer[i] is the final price you will pay for the ith item of the shop, considering the special discount.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: prices = [8,4,6,2,3]\nOutput: [4,2,4,2,3]\nExplanation: \nFor item 0 with price[0]=8 you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[1]=4, therefore, the final price you will pay is 8 - 4 = 4.\nFor item 1 with price[1]=4 you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[3]=2, therefore, the final price you will pay is 4 - 2 = 2.\nFor item 2 with price[2]=6 you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[3]=2, therefore, the final price you will pay is 6 - 2 = 4.\nFor items 3 and 4 you will not receive any discount at all.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]\nOutput: [1,2,3,4,5]\nExplanation: In this case, for all items, you will not receive any discount at all.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: prices = [10,1,1,6]\nOutput: [9,0,1,6]\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= prices.length <= 500\n\t1 <= prices[i] <= 1000\n\n"
