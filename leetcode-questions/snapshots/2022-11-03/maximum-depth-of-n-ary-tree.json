  "description": "Given a n-ary tree, find its maximum depth.\n\nThe maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.\n\nNary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal, each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples).\n\n \nExample 1:\n\n\n\nInput: root = [1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6]\nOutput: 3\n\n\nExample 2:\n\n\n\nInput: root = [1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,null,11,null,12,null,13,null,null,14]\nOutput: 5\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\tThe total number of nodes is in the range [0, 104].\n\tThe depth of the n-ary tree is less than or equal to 1000.\n\n"
