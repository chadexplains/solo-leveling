  "description": "Given a binary string s, you can split s into 3 non-empty strings s1, s2, and s3 where s1 + s2 + s3 = s.\n\nReturn the number of ways s can be split such that the number of ones is the same in s1, s2, and s3. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = \"10101\"\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: There are four ways to split s in 3 parts where each part contain the same number of letters '1'.\n\"1|010|1\"\n\"1|01|01\"\n\"10|10|1\"\n\"10|1|01\"\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s = \"1001\"\nOutput: 0\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: s = \"0000\"\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: There are three ways to split s in 3 parts.\n\"0|0|00\"\n\"0|00|0\"\n\"00|0|0\"\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t3 <= s.length <= 105\n\ts[i] is either '0' or '1'.\n\n"
