  "description": "Given an integer array nums of positive integers, return the average value of all even integers that are divisible by 3.\n\nNote that the average of n elements is the sum of the n elements divided by n and rounded down to the nearest integer.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [1,3,6,10,12,15]\nOutput: 9\nExplanation: 6 and 12 are even numbers that are divisible by 3. (6 + 12) / 2 = 9.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [1,2,4,7,10]\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: There is no single number that satisfies the requirement, so return 0.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= nums.length <= 1000\n\t1 <= nums[i] <= 1000\n\n"
