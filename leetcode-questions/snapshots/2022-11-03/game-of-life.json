  "description": "According to Wikipedia's article: \"The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.\"\n\nThe board is made up of an m x n grid of cells, where each cell has an initial state: live (represented by a 1) or dead (represented by a 0). Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):\n\n\n\tAny live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by under-population.\n\tAny live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.\n\tAny live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population.\n\tAny dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.\n\n\nThe next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and deaths occur simultaneously. Given the current state of the m x n grid board, return the next state.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: board = [[0,1,0],[0,0,1],[1,1,1],[0,0,0]]\nOutput: [[0,0,0],[1,0,1],[0,1,1],[0,1,0]]\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: board = [[1,1],[1,0]]\nOutput: [[1,1],[1,1]]\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\tm == board.length\n\tn == board[i].length\n\t1 <= m, n <= 25\n\tboard[i][j] is 0 or 1.\n\n\n \nFollow up:\n\n\n\tCould you solve it in-place? Remember that the board needs to be updated simultaneously: You cannot update some cells first and then use their updated values to update other cells.\n\tIn this question, we represent the board using a 2D array. In principle, the board is infinite, which would cause problems when the active area encroaches upon the border of the array (i.e., live cells reach the border). How would you address these problems?\n\n"
