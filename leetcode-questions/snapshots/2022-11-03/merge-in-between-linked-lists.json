  "description": "You are given two linked lists: list1 and list2 of sizes n and m respectively.\n\nRemove list1's nodes from the ath node to the bth node, and put list2 in their place.\n\nThe blue edges and nodes in the following figure indicate the result:\n\nBuild the result list and return its head.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: list1 = [0,1,2,3,4,5], a = 3, b = 4, list2 = [1000000,1000001,1000002]\nOutput: [0,1,2,1000000,1000001,1000002,5]\nExplanation: We remove the nodes 3 and 4 and put the entire list2 in their place. The blue edges and nodes in the above figure indicate the result.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: list1 = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6], a = 2, b = 5, list2 = [1000000,1000001,1000002,1000003,1000004]\nOutput: [0,1,1000000,1000001,1000002,1000003,1000004,6]\nExplanation: The blue edges and nodes in the above figure indicate the result.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t3 <= list1.length <= 104\n\t1 <= a <= b < list1.length - 1\n\t1 <= list2.length <= 104\n\n"
