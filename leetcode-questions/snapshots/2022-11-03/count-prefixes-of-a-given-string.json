  "description": "You are given a string array words and a string s, where words[i] and s comprise only of lowercase English letters.\n\nReturn the number of strings in words that are a prefix of s.\n\nA prefix of a string is a substring that occurs at the beginning of the string. A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: words = [\"a\",\"b\",\"c\",\"ab\",\"bc\",\"abc\"], s = \"abc\"\nOutput: 3\nExplanation:\nThe strings in words which are a prefix of s = \"abc\" are:\n\"a\", \"ab\", and \"abc\".\nThus the number of strings in words which are a prefix of s is 3.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: words = [\"a\",\"a\"], s = \"aa\"\nOutput: 2\nExplanation:\nBoth of the strings are a prefix of s. \nNote that the same string can occur multiple times in words, and it should be counted each time.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= words.length <= 1000\n\t1 <= words[i].length, s.length <= 10\n\twords[i] and s consist of lowercase English letters only.\n\n"
