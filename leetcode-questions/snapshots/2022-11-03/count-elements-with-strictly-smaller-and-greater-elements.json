  "description": "Given an integer array nums, return the number of elements that have both a strictly smaller and a strictly greater element appear in nums.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [11,7,2,15]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: The element 7 has the element 2 strictly smaller than it and the element 11 strictly greater than it.\nElement 11 has element 7 strictly smaller than it and element 15 strictly greater than it.\nIn total there are 2 elements having both a strictly smaller and a strictly greater element appear in nums.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [-3,3,3,90]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: The element 3 has the element -3 strictly smaller than it and the element 90 strictly greater than it.\nSince there are two elements with the value 3, in total there are 2 elements having both a strictly smaller and a strictly greater element appear in nums.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= nums.length <= 100\n\t-105 <= nums[i] <= 105\n\n"
