  "description": "You are given an integer array nums. You want to maximize the number of points you get by performing the following operation any number of times:\n\n\n\tPick any nums[i] and delete it to earn nums[i] points. Afterwards, you must delete every element equal to nums[i] - 1 and every element equal to nums[i] + 1.\n\n\nReturn the maximum number of points you can earn by applying the above operation some number of times.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [3,4,2]\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: You can perform the following operations:\n- Delete 4 to earn 4 points. Consequently, 3 is also deleted. nums = [2].\n- Delete 2 to earn 2 points. nums = [].\nYou earn a total of 6 points.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [2,2,3,3,3,4]\nOutput: 9\nExplanation: You can perform the following operations:\n- Delete a 3 to earn 3 points. All 2's and 4's are also deleted. nums = [3,3].\n- Delete a 3 again to earn 3 points. nums = [3].\n- Delete a 3 once more to earn 3 points. nums = [].\nYou earn a total of 9 points.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104\n\t1 <= nums[i] <= 104\n\n"
