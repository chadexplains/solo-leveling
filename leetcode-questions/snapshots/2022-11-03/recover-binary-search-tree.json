  "description": "You are given the root of a binary search tree (BST), where the values of exactly two nodes of the tree were swapped by mistake. Recover the tree without changing its structure.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: root = [1,3,null,null,2]\nOutput: [3,1,null,null,2]\nExplanation: 3 cannot be a left child of 1 because 3 > 1. Swapping 1 and 3 makes the BST valid.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: root = [3,1,4,null,null,2]\nOutput: [2,1,4,null,null,3]\nExplanation: 2 cannot be in the right subtree of 3 because 2 < 3. Swapping 2 and 3 makes the BST valid.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\tThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 1000].\n\t-231 <= Node.val <= 231 - 1\n\n\n \nFollow up: A solution using O(n) space is pretty straight-forward. Could you devise a constant O(1) space solution?"
