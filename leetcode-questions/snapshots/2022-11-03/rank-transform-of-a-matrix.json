  "description": "Given an m x n matrix, return a new matrix answer where answer[row][col] is the rank of matrix[row][col].\n\nThe rank is an integer that represents how large an element is compared to other elements. It is calculated using the following rules:\n\n\n\tThe rank is an integer starting from 1.\n\tIf two elements p and q are in the same row or column, then:\n\t\n\t\tIf p < q then rank(p) < rank(q)\n\t\tIf p == q then rank(p) == rank(q)\n\t\tIf p > q then rank(p) > rank(q)\n\t\n\t\n\tThe rank should be as small as possible.\n\n\nThe test cases are generated so that answer is unique under the given rules.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: matrix = [[1,2],[3,4]]\nOutput: [[1,2],[2,3]]\nExplanation:\nThe rank of matrix[0][0] is 1 because it is the smallest integer in its row and column.\nThe rank of matrix[0][1] is 2 because matrix[0][1] > matrix[0][0] and matrix[0][0] is rank 1.\nThe rank of matrix[1][0] is 2 because matrix[1][0] > matrix[0][0] and matrix[0][0] is rank 1.\nThe rank of matrix[1][1] is 3 because matrix[1][1] > matrix[0][1], matrix[1][1] > matrix[1][0], and both matrix[0][1] and matrix[1][0] are rank 2.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: matrix = [[7,7],[7,7]]\nOutput: [[1,1],[1,1]]\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: matrix = [[20,-21,14],[-19,4,19],[22,-47,24],[-19,4,19]]\nOutput: [[4,2,3],[1,3,4],[5,1,6],[1,3,4]]\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\tm == matrix.length\n\tn == matrix[i].length\n\t1 <= m, n <= 500\n\t-109 <= matrix[row][col] <= 109\n\n"
