  "description": "You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.\n\nFind the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete at most two transactions.\n\nNote: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: prices = [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.\nThen buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.\nNote that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= prices.length <= 105\n\t0 <= prices[i] <= 105\n\n"
