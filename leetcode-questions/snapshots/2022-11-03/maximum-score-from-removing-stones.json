  "description": "You are playing a solitaire game with three piles of stones of sizes a​​​​​​, b,​​​​​​ and c​​​​​​ respectively. Each turn you choose two different non-empty piles, take one stone from each, and add 1 point to your score. The game stops when there are fewer than two non-empty piles (meaning there are no more available moves).\n\nGiven three integers a​​​​​, b,​​​​​ and c​​​​​, return the maximum score you can get.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: a = 2, b = 4, c = 6\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: The starting state is (2, 4, 6). One optimal set of moves is:\n- Take from 1st and 3rd piles, state is now (1, 4, 5)\n- Take from 1st and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 4, 4)\n- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 3, 3)\n- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 2, 2)\n- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 1, 1)\n- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 0, 0)\nThere are fewer than two non-empty piles, so the game ends. Total: 6 points.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: a = 4, b = 4, c = 6\nOutput: 7\nExplanation: The starting state is (4, 4, 6). One optimal set of moves is:\n- Take from 1st and 2nd piles, state is now (3, 3, 6)\n- Take from 1st and 3rd piles, state is now (2, 3, 5)\n- Take from 1st and 3rd piles, state is now (1, 3, 4)\n- Take from 1st and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 3, 3)\n- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 2, 2)\n- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 1, 1)\n- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 0, 0)\nThere are fewer than two non-empty piles, so the game ends. Total: 7 points.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: a = 1, b = 8, c = 8\nOutput: 8\nExplanation: One optimal set of moves is to take from the 2nd and 3rd piles for 8 turns until they are empty.\nAfter that, there are fewer than two non-empty piles, so the game ends.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= a, b, c <= 105\n\n"
