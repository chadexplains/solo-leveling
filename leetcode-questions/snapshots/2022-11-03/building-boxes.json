You are asked to place n boxes in this room where each box is a cube of unit side length. There are however some rules to placing the boxes:\n\n\n\tYou can place the boxes anywhere on the floor.\n\tIf box x is placed on top of the box y, then each side of the four vertical sides of the box y must either be adjacent to another box or to a wall.\n\n\nGiven an integer n, return the minimum possible number of boxes touching the floor.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\n\n\nInput: n = 3\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: The figure above is for the placement of the three boxes.\nThese boxes are placed in the corner of the room, where the corner is on the left side.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\n\n\nInput: n = 4\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: The figure above is for the placement of the four boxes.\nThese boxes are placed in the corner of the room, where the corner is on the left side.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\n\n\nInput: n = 10\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: The figure above is for the placement of the ten boxes.\nThese boxes are placed in the corner of the room, where the corner is on the back side.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= n <= 109\n\n"
