  "description": "You are given a 0-indexed array of n integers arr.\n\nThe interval between two elements in arr is defined as the absolute difference between their indices. More formally, the interval between arr[i] and arr[j] is |i - j|.\n\nReturn an array intervals of length n where intervals[i] is the sum of intervals between arr[i] and each element in arr with the same value as arr[i].\n\nNote: |x| is the absolute value of x.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: arr = [2,1,3,1,2,3,3]\nOutput: [4,2,7,2,4,4,5]\nExplanation:\n- Index 0: Another 2 is found at index 4. |0 - 4| = 4\n- Index 1: Another 1 is found at index 3. |1 - 3| = 2\n- Index 2: Two more 3s are found at indices 5 and 6. |2 - 5| + |2 - 6| = 7\n- Index 3: Another 1 is found at index 1. |3 - 1| = 2\n- Index 4: Another 2 is found at index 0. |4 - 0| = 4\n- Index 5: Two more 3s are found at indices 2 and 6. |5 - 2| + |5 - 6| = 4\n- Index 6: Two more 3s are found at indices 2 and 5. |6 - 2| + |6 - 5| = 5\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: arr = [10,5,10,10]\nOutput: [5,0,3,4]\nExplanation:\n- Index 0: Two more 10s are found at indices 2 and 3. |0 - 2| + |0 - 3| = 5\n- Index 1: There is only one 5 in the array, so its sum of intervals to identical elements is 0.\n- Index 2: Two more 10s are found at indices 0 and 3. |2 - 0| + |2 - 3| = 3\n- Index 3: Two more 10s are found at indices 0 and 2. |3 - 0| + |3 - 2| = 4\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\tn == arr.length\n\t1 <= n <= 105\n\t1 <= arr[i] <= 105\n\n"
