  "description": "Given the root node of a binary search tree and two integers low and high, return the sum of values of all nodes with a value in the inclusive range [low, high].\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: root = [10,5,15,3,7,null,18], low = 7, high = 15\nOutput: 32\nExplanation: Nodes 7, 10, and 15 are in the range [7, 15]. 7 + 10 + 15 = 32.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: root = [10,5,15,3,7,13,18,1,null,6], low = 6, high = 10\nOutput: 23\nExplanation: Nodes 6, 7, and 10 are in the range [6, 10]. 6 + 7 + 10 = 23.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\tThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 2 * 104].\n\t1 <= Node.val <= 105\n\t1 <= low <= high <= 105\n\tAll Node.val are unique.\n\n"
