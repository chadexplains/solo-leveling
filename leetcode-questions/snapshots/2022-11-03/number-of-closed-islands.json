  "description": "Given a 2D grid consists of 0s (land) and 1s (water).  An island is a maximal 4-directionally connected group of 0s and a closed island is an island totally (all left, top, right, bottom) surrounded by 1s.\n\nReturn the number of closed islands.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\n\n\nInput: grid = [[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0],[1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0],[1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0],[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0]]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: \nIslands in gray are closed because they are completely surrounded by water (group of 1s).\n\nExample 2:\n\n\n\nInput: grid = [[0,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,1,0],[0,1,1,1,0]]\nOutput: 1\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: grid = [[1,1,1,1,1,1,1],\n               [1,0,0,0,0,0,1],\n               [1,0,1,1,1,0,1],\n               [1,0,1,0,1,0,1],\n               [1,0,1,1,1,0,1],\n               [1,0,0,0,0,0,1],\n               [1,1,1,1,1,1,1]]\nOutput: 2\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= grid.length, grid[0].length <= 100\n\t0 <= grid[i][j] <=1\n\n"
