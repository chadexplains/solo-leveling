  "description": "You are given an integer array rolls of length n and an integer k. You roll a k sided dice numbered from 1 to k, n times, where the result of the ith roll is rolls[i].\n\nReturn the length of the shortest sequence of rolls that cannot be taken from rolls.\n\nA sequence of rolls of length len is the result of rolling a k sided dice len times.\n\nNote that the sequence taken does not have to be consecutive as long as it is in order.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: rolls = [4,2,1,2,3,3,2,4,1], k = 4\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: Every sequence of rolls of length 1, [1], [2], [3], [4], can be taken from rolls.\nEvery sequence of rolls of length 2, [1, 1], [1, 2], ..., [4, 4], can be taken from rolls.\nThe sequence [1, 4, 2] cannot be taken from rolls, so we return 3.\nNote that there are other sequences that cannot be taken from rolls.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: rolls = [1,1,2,2], k = 2\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: Every sequence of rolls of length 1, [1], [2], can be taken from rolls.\nThe sequence [2, 1] cannot be taken from rolls, so we return 2.\nNote that there are other sequences that cannot be taken from rolls but [2, 1] is the shortest.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: rolls = [1,1,3,2,2,2,3,3], k = 4\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: The sequence [4] cannot be taken from rolls, so we return 1.\nNote that there are other sequences that cannot be taken from rolls but [4] is the shortest.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\tn == rolls.length\n\t1 <= n <= 105\n\t1 <= rolls[i] <= k <= 105\n\n"
