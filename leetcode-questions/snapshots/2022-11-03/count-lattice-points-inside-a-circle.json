  "description": "Given a 2D integer array circles where circles[i] = [xi, yi, ri] represents the center (xi, yi) and radius ri of the ith circle drawn on a grid, return the number of lattice points that are present inside at least one circle.\n\nNote:\n\n\n\tA lattice point is a point with integer coordinates.\n\tPoints that lie on the circumference of a circle are also considered to be inside it.\n\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: circles = [[2,2,1]]\nOutput: 5\nExplanation:\nThe figure above shows the given circle.\nThe lattice points present inside the circle are (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), and (3, 2) and are shown in green.\nOther points such as (1, 1) and (1, 3), which are shown in red, are not considered inside the circle.\nHence, the number of lattice points present inside at least one circle is 5.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: circles = [[2,2,2],[3,4,1]]\nOutput: 16\nExplanation:\nThe figure above shows the given circles.\nThere are exactly 16 lattice points which are present inside at least one circle. \nSome of them are (0, 2), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 2), and (4, 4).\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= circles.length <= 200\n\tcircles[i].length == 3\n\t1 <= xi, yi <= 100\n\t1 <= ri <= min(xi, yi)\n\n"
