  "description": "Tic-tac-toe is played by two players A and B on a 3 x 3 grid. The rules of Tic-Tac-Toe are:\n\n\n\tPlayers take turns placing characters into empty squares ' '.\n\tThe first player A always places 'X' characters, while the second player B always places 'O' characters.\n\t'X' and 'O' characters are always placed into empty squares, never on filled ones.\n\tThe game ends when there are three of the same (non-empty) character filling any row, column, or diagonal.\n\tThe game also ends if all squares are non-empty.\n\tNo more moves can be played if the game is over.\n\n\nGiven a 2D integer array moves where moves[i] = [rowi, coli] indicates that the ith move will be played on grid[rowi][coli]. return the winner of the game if it exists (A or B). In case the game ends in a draw return \"Draw\". If there are still movements to play return \"Pending\".\n\nYou can assume that moves is valid (i.e., it follows the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe), the grid is initially empty, and A will play first.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: moves = [[0,0],[2,0],[1,1],[2,1],[2,2]]\nOutput: \"A\"\nExplanation: A wins, they always play first.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: moves = [[0,0],[1,1],[0,1],[0,2],[1,0],[2,0]]\nOutput: \"B\"\nExplanation: B wins.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: moves = [[0,0],[1,1],[2,0],[1,0],[1,2],[2,1],[0,1],[0,2],[2,2]]\nOutput: \"Draw\"\nExplanation: The game ends in a draw since there are no moves to make.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= moves.length <= 9\n\tmoves[i].length == 2\n\t0 <= rowi, coli <= 2\n\tThere are no repeated elements on moves.\n\tmoves follow the rules of tic tac toe.\n\n"
