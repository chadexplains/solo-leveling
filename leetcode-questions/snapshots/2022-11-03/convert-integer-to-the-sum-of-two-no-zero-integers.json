  "description": "No-Zero integer is a positive integer that does not contain any 0 in its decimal representation.\n\nGiven an integer n, return a list of two integers [A, B] where:\n\n\n\tA and B are No-Zero integers.\n\tA + B = n\n\n\nThe test cases are generated so that there is at least one valid solution. If there are many valid solutions you can return any of them.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: n = 2\nOutput: [1,1]\nExplanation: A = 1, B = 1. A + B = n and both A and B do not contain any 0 in their decimal representation.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: n = 11\nOutput: [2,9]\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t2 <= n <= 104\n\n"
