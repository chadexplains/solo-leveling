  "description": "Given two strings s1 and s2, return the lowest ASCII sum of deleted characters to make two strings equal.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: s1 = \"sea\", s2 = \"eat\"\nOutput: 231\nExplanation: Deleting \"s\" from \"sea\" adds the ASCII value of \"s\" (115) to the sum.\nDeleting \"t\" from \"eat\" adds 116 to the sum.\nAt the end, both strings are equal, and 115 + 116 = 231 is the minimum sum possible to achieve this.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s1 = \"delete\", s2 = \"leet\"\nOutput: 403\nExplanation: Deleting \"dee\" from \"delete\" to turn the string into \"let\",\nadds 100[d] + 101[e] + 101[e] to the sum.\nDeleting \"e\" from \"leet\" adds 101[e] to the sum.\nAt the end, both strings are equal to \"let\", and the answer is 100+101+101+101 = 403.\nIf instead we turned both strings into \"lee\" or \"eet\", we would get answers of 433 or 417, which are higher.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 1000\n\ts1 and s2 consist of lowercase English letters.\n\n"
