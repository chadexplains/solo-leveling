  "description": "You are given a 2D integer array logs where each logs[i] = [birthi, deathi] indicates the birth and death years of the ith person.\n\nThe population of some year x is the number of people alive during that year. The ith person is counted in year x's population if x is in the inclusive range [birthi, deathi - 1]. Note that the person is not counted in the year that they die.\n\nReturn the earliest year with the maximum population.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: logs = [[1993,1999],[2000,2010]]\nOutput: 1993\nExplanation: The maximum population is 1, and 1993 is the earliest year with this population.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: logs = [[1950,1961],[1960,1971],[1970,1981]]\nOutput: 1960\nExplanation: \nThe maximum population is 2, and it had happened in years 1960 and 1970.\nThe earlier year between them is 1960.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= logs.length <= 100\n\t1950 <= birthi < deathi <= 2050\n\n"
