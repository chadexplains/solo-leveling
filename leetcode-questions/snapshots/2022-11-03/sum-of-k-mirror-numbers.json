  "description": "A k-mirror number is a positive integer without leading zeros that reads the same both forward and backward in base-10 as well as in base-k.\n\n\n\tFor example, 9 is a 2-mirror number. The representation of 9 in base-10 and base-2 are 9 and 1001 respectively, which read the same both forward and backward.\n\tOn the contrary, 4 is not a 2-mirror number. The representation of 4 in base-2 is 100, which does not read the same both forward and backward.\n\n\nGiven the base k and the number n, return the sum of the n smallest k-mirror numbers.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: k = 2, n = 5\nOutput: 25\nExplanation:\nThe 5 smallest 2-mirror numbers and their representations in base-2 are listed as follows:\n  base-10    base-2\n    1          1\n    3          11\n    5          101\n    7          111\n    9          1001\nTheir sum = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 25. \n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: k = 3, n = 7\nOutput: 499\nExplanation:\nThe 7 smallest 3-mirror numbers are and their representations in base-3 are listed as follows:\n  base-10    base-3\n    1          1\n    2          2\n    4          11\n    8          22\n    121        11111\n    151        12121\n    212        21212\nTheir sum = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 121 + 151 + 212 = 499.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: k = 7, n = 17\nOutput: 20379000\nExplanation: The 17 smallest 7-mirror numbers are:\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 121, 171, 242, 292, 16561, 65656, 2137312, 4602064, 6597956, 6958596\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t2 <= k <= 9\n\t1 <= n <= 30\n\n"
