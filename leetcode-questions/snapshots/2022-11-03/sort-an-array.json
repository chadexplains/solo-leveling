  "description": "Given an array of integers nums, sort the array in ascending order and return it.\n\nYou must solve the problem without using any built-in functions in O(nlog(n)) time complexity and with the smallest space complexity possible.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [5,2,3,1]\nOutput: [1,2,3,5]\nExplanation: After sorting the array, the positions of some numbers are not changed (for example, 2 and 3), while the positions of other numbers are changed (for example, 1 and 5).\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [5,1,1,2,0,0]\nOutput: [0,0,1,1,2,5]\nExplanation: Note that the values of nums are not necessairly unique.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= nums.length <= 5 * 104\n\t-5 * 104 <= nums[i] <= 5 * 104\n\n"
