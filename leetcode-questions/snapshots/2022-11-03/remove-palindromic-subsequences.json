  "description": "You are given a string s consisting only of letters 'a' and 'b'. In a single step you can remove one palindromic subsequence from s.\n\nReturn the minimum number of steps to make the given string empty.\n\nA string is a subsequence of a given string if it is generated by deleting some characters of a given string without changing its order. Note that a subsequence does not necessarily need to be contiguous.\n\nA string is called palindrome if is one that reads the same backward as well as forward.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = \"ababa\"\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: s is already a palindrome, so its entirety can be removed in a single step.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s = \"abb\"\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: \"abb\" -> \"bb\" -> \"\". \nRemove palindromic subsequence \"a\" then \"bb\".\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: s = \"baabb\"\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: \"baabb\" -> \"b\" -> \"\". \nRemove palindromic subsequence \"baab\" then \"b\".\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= s.length <= 1000\n\ts[i] is either 'a' or 'b'.\n\n"
