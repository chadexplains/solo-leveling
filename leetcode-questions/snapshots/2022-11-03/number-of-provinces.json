If city a is connected directly with city b, and city b is connected directly with city c, then city a is connected indirectly with city c.\n\nA province is a group of directly or indirectly connected cities and no other cities outside of the group.\n\nYou are given an n x n matrix isConnected where isConnected[i][j] = 1 if the ith city and the jth city are directly connected, and isConnected[i][j] = 0 otherwise.\n\nReturn the total number of provinces.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: isConnected = [[1,1,0],[1,1,0],[0,0,1]]\nOutput: 2\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: isConnected = [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]]\nOutput: 3\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= n <= 200\n\tn == isConnected.length\n\tn == isConnected[i].length\n\tisConnected[i][j] is 1 or 0.\n\tisConnected[i][i] == 1\n\tisConnected[i][j] == isConnected[j][i]\n\n"
