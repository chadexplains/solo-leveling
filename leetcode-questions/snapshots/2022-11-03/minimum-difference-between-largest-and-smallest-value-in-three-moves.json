  "description": "You are given an integer array nums.\n\nIn one move, you can choose one element of nums and change it to any value.\n\nReturn the minimum difference between the largest and smallest value of nums after performing at most three moves.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [5,3,2,4]\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: We can make at most 3 moves.\nIn the first move, change 2 to 3. nums becomes [5,3,3,4].\nIn the second move, change 4 to 3. nums becomes [5,3,3,3].\nIn the third move, change 5 to 3. nums becomes [3,3,3,3].\nAfter performing 3 moves, the difference between the minimum and maximum is 3 - 3 = 0.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [1,5,0,10,14]\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: We can make at most 3 moves.\nIn the first move, change 5 to 0. nums becomes [1,0,0,10,14].\nIn the second move, change 10 to 0. nums becomes [1,0,0,0,14].\nIn the third move, change 14 to 1. nums becomes [1,0,0,0,1].\nAfter performing 3 moves, the difference between the minimum and maximum is 1 - 0 = 0.\nIt can be shown that there is no way to make the difference 0 in 3 moves.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: nums = [3,100,20]\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: We can make at most 3 moves.\nIn the first move, change 100 to 7. nums becomes [4,7,20].\nIn the second move, change 20 to 7. nums becomes [4,7,7].\nIn the third move, change 4 to 3. nums becomes [7,7,7].\nAfter performing 3 moves, the difference between the minimum and maximum is 7 - 7 = 0.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= nums.length <= 105\n\t-109 <= nums[i] <= 109\n\n"
