  "description": "A magical string s consists of only '1' and '2' and obeys the following rules:\n\n\n\tThe string s is magical because concatenating the number of contiguous occurrences of characters '1' and '2' generates the string s itself.\n\n\nThe first few elements of s is s = \"1221121221221121122……\". If we group the consecutive 1's and 2's in s, it will be \"1 22 11 2 1 22 1 22 11 2 11 22 ......\" and the occurrences of 1's or 2's in each group are \"1 2 2 1 1 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 ......\". You can see that the occurrence sequence is s itself.\n\nGiven an integer n, return the number of 1's in the first n number in the magical string s.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: n = 6\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: The first 6 elements of magical string s is \"122112\" and it contains three 1's, so return 3.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: n = 1\nOutput: 1\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= n <= 105\n\n"
