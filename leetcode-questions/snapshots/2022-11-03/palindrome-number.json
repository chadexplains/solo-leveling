  "description": "Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: x = 121\nOutput: true\nExplanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: x = -121\nOutput: false\nExplanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: x = 10\nOutput: false\nExplanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t-231 <= x <= 231 - 1\n\n\n \nFollow up: Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?"
