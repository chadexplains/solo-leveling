  "description": "Given a 0-indexed integer array nums of length n and an integer k, return the number of pairs (i, j) such that:\n\n\n\t0 <= i < j <= n - 1 and\n\tnums[i] * nums[j] is divisible by k.\n\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2\nOutput: 7\nExplanation: \nThe 7 pairs of indices whose corresponding products are divisible by 2 are\n(0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), and (3, 4).\nTheir products are 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 20 respectively.\nOther pairs such as (0, 2) and (2, 4) have products 3 and 15 respectively, which are not divisible by 2.    \n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [1,2,3,4], k = 5\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: There does not exist any pair of indices whose corresponding product is divisible by 5.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= nums.length <= 105\n\t1 <= nums[i], k <= 105\n\n"
