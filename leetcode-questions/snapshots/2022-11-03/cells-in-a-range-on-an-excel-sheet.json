  "description": "A cell (r, c) of an excel sheet is represented as a string \"<col><row>\" where:\n\n\n\t<col> denotes the column number c of the cell. It is represented by alphabetical letters.\n\n\t\n\t\tFor example, the 1st column is denoted by 'A', the 2nd by 'B', the 3rd by 'C', and so on.\n\t\n\t\n\t<row> is the row number r of the cell. The rth row is represented by the integer r.\n\n\nYou are given a string s in the format \"<col1><row1>:<col2><row2>\", where <col1> represents the column c1, <row1> represents the row r1, <col2> represents the column c2, and <row2> represents the row r2, such that r1 <= r2 and c1 <= c2.\n\nReturn the list of cells (x, y) such that r1 <= x <= r2 and c1 <= y <= c2. The cells should be represented as strings in the format mentioned above and be sorted in non-decreasing order first by columns and then by rows.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = \"K1:L2\"\nOutput: [\"K1\",\"K2\",\"L1\",\"L2\"]\nExplanation:\nThe above diagram shows the cells which should be present in the list.\nThe red arrows denote the order in which the cells should be presented.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s = \"A1:F1\"\nOutput: [\"A1\",\"B1\",\"C1\",\"D1\",\"E1\",\"F1\"]\nExplanation:\nThe above diagram shows the cells which should be present in the list.\nThe red arrow denotes the order in which the cells should be presented.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\ts.length == 5\n\t'A' <= s[0] <= s[3] <= 'Z'\n\t'1' <= s[1] <= s[4] <= '9'\n\ts consists of uppercase English letters, digits and ':'.\n\n"
