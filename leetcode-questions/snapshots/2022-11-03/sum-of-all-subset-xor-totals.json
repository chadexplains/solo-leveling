  "description": "The XOR total of an array is defined as the bitwise XOR of all its elements, or 0 if the array is empty.\n\n\n\tFor example, the XOR total of the array [2,5,6] is 2 XOR 5 XOR 6 = 1.\n\n\nGiven an array nums, return the sum of all XOR totals for every subset of nums. \n\nNote: Subsets with the same elements should be counted multiple times.\n\nAn array a is a subset of an array b if a can be obtained from b by deleting some (possibly zero) elements of b.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [1,3]\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: The 4 subsets of [1,3] are:\n- The empty subset has an XOR total of 0.\n- [1] has an XOR total of 1.\n- [3] has an XOR total of 3.\n- [1,3] has an XOR total of 1 XOR 3 = 2.\n0 + 1 + 3 + 2 = 6\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [5,1,6]\nOutput: 28\nExplanation: The 8 subsets of [5,1,6] are:\n- The empty subset has an XOR total of 0.\n- [5] has an XOR total of 5.\n- [1] has an XOR total of 1.\n- [6] has an XOR total of 6.\n- [5,1] has an XOR total of 5 XOR 1 = 4.\n- [5,6] has an XOR total of 5 XOR 6 = 3.\n- [1,6] has an XOR total of 1 XOR 6 = 7.\n- [5,1,6] has an XOR total of 5 XOR 1 XOR 6 = 2.\n0 + 5 + 1 + 6 + 4 + 3 + 7 + 2 = 28\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: nums = [3,4,5,6,7,8]\nOutput: 480\nExplanation: The sum of all XOR totals for every subset is 480.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= nums.length <= 12\n\t1 <= nums[i] <= 20\n\n"
