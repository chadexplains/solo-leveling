  "description": "You are given an integer n. There is an undirected graph with n nodes, numbered from 0 to n - 1. You are given a 2D integer array edges where edges[i] = [ai, bi] denotes that there exists an undirected edge connecting nodes ai and bi.\n\nReturn the number of pairs of different nodes that are unreachable from each other.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,2]]\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: There are no pairs of nodes that are unreachable from each other. Therefore, we return 0.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: n = 7, edges = [[0,2],[0,5],[2,4],[1,6],[5,4]]\nOutput: 14\nExplanation: There are 14 pairs of nodes that are unreachable from each other:\n[[0,1],[0,3],[0,6],[1,2],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,6],[3,4],[3,5],[3,6],[4,6],[5,6]].\nTherefore, we return 14.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= n <= 105\n\t0 <= edges.length <= 2 * 105\n\tedges[i].length == 2\n\t0 <= ai, bi < n\n\tai != bi\n\tThere are no repeated edges.\n\n"
