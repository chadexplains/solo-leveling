  "description": "You are given two images, img1 and img2, represented as binary, square matrices of size n x n. A binary matrix has only 0s and 1s as values.\n\nWe translate one image however we choose by sliding all the 1 bits left, right, up, and/or down any number of units. We then place it on top of the other image. We can then calculate the overlap by counting the number of positions that have a 1 in both images.\n\nNote also that a translation does not include any kind of rotation. Any 1 bits that are translated outside of the matrix borders are erased.\n\nReturn the largest possible overlap.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: img1 = [[1,1,0],[0,1,0],[0,1,0]], img2 = [[0,0,0],[0,1,1],[0,0,1]]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: We translate img1 to right by 1 unit and down by 1 unit.\n\nThe number of positions that have a 1 in both images is 3 (shown in red).\n\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: img1 = [[1]], img2 = [[1]]\nOutput: 1\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: img1 = [[0]], img2 = [[0]]\nOutput: 0\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\tn == img1.length == img1[i].length\n\tn == img2.length == img2[i].length\n\t1 <= n <= 30\n\timg1[i][j] is either 0 or 1.\n\timg2[i][j] is either 0 or 1.\n\n"
