  "description": "A bus has n stops numbered from 0 to n - 1 that form a circle. We know the distance between all pairs of neighboring stops where distance[i] is the distance between the stops number i and (i + 1) % n.\n\nThe bus goes along both directions i.e. clockwise and counterclockwise.\n\nReturn the shortest distance between the given start and destination stops.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\n\n\nInput: distance = [1,2,3,4], start = 0, destination = 1\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: Distance between 0 and 1 is 1 or 9, minimum is 1.\n\n \n\nExample 2:\n\n\n\nInput: distance = [1,2,3,4], start = 0, destination = 2\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: Distance between 0 and 2 is 3 or 7, minimum is 3.\n\n\n \n\nExample 3:\n\n\n\nInput: distance = [1,2,3,4], start = 0, destination = 3\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: Distance between 0 and 3 is 6 or 4, minimum is 4.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= n <= 10^4\n\tdistance.length == n\n\t0 <= start, destination < n\n\t0 <= distance[i] <= 10^4\n"
