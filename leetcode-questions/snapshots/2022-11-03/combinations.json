  "description": "Given two integers n and k, return all possible combinations of k numbers chosen from the range [1, n].\n\nYou may return the answer in any order.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: n = 4, k = 2\nOutput: [[1,2],[1,3],[1,4],[2,3],[2,4],[3,4]]\nExplanation: There are 4 choose 2 = 6 total combinations.\nNote that combinations are unordered, i.e., [1,2] and [2,1] are considered to be the same combination.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: n = 1, k = 1\nOutput: [[1]]\nExplanation: There is 1 choose 1 = 1 total combination.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= n <= 20\n\t1 <= k <= n\n\n"
