  "description": "Given an m x n integer matrix heightMap representing the height of each unit cell in a 2D elevation map, return the volume of water it can trap after raining.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: heightMap = [[1,4,3,1,3,2],[3,2,1,3,2,4],[2,3,3,2,3,1]]\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: After the rain, water is trapped between the blocks.\nWe have two small ponds 1 and 3 units trapped.\nThe total volume of water trapped is 4.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: heightMap = [[3,3,3,3,3],[3,2,2,2,3],[3,2,1,2,3],[3,2,2,2,3],[3,3,3,3,3]]\nOutput: 10\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\tm == heightMap.length\n\tn == heightMap[i].length\n\t1 <= m, n <= 200\n\t0 <= heightMap[i][j] <= 2 * 104\n\n"
