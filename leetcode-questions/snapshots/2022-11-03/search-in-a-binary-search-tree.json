  "description": "You are given the root of a binary search tree (BST) and an integer val.\n\nFind the node in the BST that the node's value equals val and return the subtree rooted with that node. If such a node does not exist, return null.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: root = [4,2,7,1,3], val = 2\nOutput: [2,1,3]\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: root = [4,2,7,1,3], val = 5\nOutput: []\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\tThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 5000].\n\t1 <= Node.val <= 107\n\troot is a binary search tree.\n\t1 <= val <= 107\n\n"
