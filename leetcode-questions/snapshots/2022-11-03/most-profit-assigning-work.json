  "description": "You have n jobs and m workers. You are given three arrays: difficulty, profit, and worker where:\n\n\n\tdifficulty[i] and profit[i] are the difficulty and the profit of the ith job, and\n\tworker[j] is the ability of jth worker (i.e., the jth worker can only complete a job with difficulty at most worker[j]).\n\n\nEvery worker can be assigned at most one job, but one job can be completed multiple times.\n\n\n\tFor example, if three workers attempt the same job that pays $1, then the total profit will be $3. If a worker cannot complete any job, their profit is $0.\n\n\nReturn the maximum profit we can achieve after assigning the workers to the jobs.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: difficulty = [2,4,6,8,10], profit = [10,20,30,40,50], worker = [4,5,6,7]\nOutput: 100\nExplanation: Workers are assigned jobs of difficulty [4,4,6,6] and they get a profit of [20,20,30,30] separately.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: difficulty = [85,47,57], profit = [24,66,99], worker = [40,25,25]\nOutput: 0\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\tn == difficulty.length\n\tn == profit.length\n\tm == worker.length\n\t1 <= n, m <= 104\n\t1 <= difficulty[i], profit[i], worker[i] <= 105\n\n"
