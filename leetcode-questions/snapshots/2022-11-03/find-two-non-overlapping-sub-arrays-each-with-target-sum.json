  "description": "You are given an array of integers arr and an integer target.\n\nYou have to find two non-overlapping sub-arrays of arr each with a sum equal target. There can be multiple answers so you have to find an answer where the sum of the lengths of the two sub-arrays is minimum.\n\nReturn the minimum sum of the lengths of the two required sub-arrays, or return -1 if you cannot find such two sub-arrays.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: arr = [3,2,2,4,3], target = 3\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: Only two sub-arrays have sum = 3 ([3] and [3]). The sum of their lengths is 2.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: arr = [7,3,4,7], target = 7\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: Although we have three non-overlapping sub-arrays of sum = 7 ([7], [3,4] and [7]), but we will choose the first and third sub-arrays as the sum of their lengths is 2.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: arr = [4,3,2,6,2,3,4], target = 6\nOutput: -1\nExplanation: We have only one sub-array of sum = 6.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= arr.length <= 105\n\t1 <= arr[i] <= 1000\n\t1 <= target <= 108\n\n"
