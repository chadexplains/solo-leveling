  "description": "You are given a phone number as a string number. number consists of digits, spaces ' ', and/or dashes '-'.\n\nYou would like to reformat the phone number in a certain manner. Firstly, remove all spaces and dashes. Then, group the digits from left to right into blocks of length 3 until there are 4 or fewer digits. The final digits are then grouped as follows:\n\n\n\t2 digits: A single block of length 2.\n\t3 digits: A single block of length 3.\n\t4 digits: Two blocks of length 2 each.\n\n\nThe blocks are then joined by dashes. Notice that the reformatting process should never produce any blocks of length 1 and produce at most two blocks of length 2.\n\nReturn the phone number after formatting.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: number = \"1-23-45 6\"\nOutput: \"123-456\"\nExplanation: The digits are \"123456\".\nStep 1: There are more than 4 digits, so group the next 3 digits. The 1st block is \"123\".\nStep 2: There are 3 digits remaining, so put them in a single block of length 3. The 2nd block is \"456\".\nJoining the blocks gives \"123-456\".\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: number = \"123 4-567\"\nOutput: \"123-45-67\"\nExplanation: The digits are \"1234567\".\nStep 1: There are more than 4 digits, so group the next 3 digits. The 1st block is \"123\".\nStep 2: There are 4 digits left, so split them into two blocks of length 2. The blocks are \"45\" and \"67\".\nJoining the blocks gives \"123-45-67\".\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: number = \"123 4-5678\"\nOutput: \"123-456-78\"\nExplanation: The digits are \"12345678\".\nStep 1: The 1st block is \"123\".\nStep 2: The 2nd block is \"456\".\nStep 3: There are 2 digits left, so put them in a single block of length 2. The 3rd block is \"78\".\nJoining the blocks gives \"123-456-78\".\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t2 <= number.length <= 100\n\tnumber consists of digits and the characters '-' and ' '.\n\tThere are at least two digits in number.\n\n"
