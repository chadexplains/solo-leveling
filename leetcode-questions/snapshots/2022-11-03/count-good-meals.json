  "description": "A good meal is a meal that contains exactly two different food items with a sum of deliciousness equal to a power of two.\n\nYou can pick any two different foods to make a good meal.\n\nGiven an array of integers deliciousness where deliciousness[i] is the deliciousness of the i​​​​​​th​​​​​​​​ item of food, return the number of different good meals you can make from this list modulo 109 + 7.\n\nNote that items with different indices are considered different even if they have the same deliciousness value.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: deliciousness = [1,3,5,7,9]\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: The good meals are (1,3), (1,7), (3,5) and, (7,9).\nTheir respective sums are 4, 8, 8, and 16, all of which are powers of 2.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: deliciousness = [1,1,1,3,3,3,7]\nOutput: 15\nExplanation: The good meals are (1,1) with 3 ways, (1,3) with 9 ways, and (1,7) with 3 ways.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= deliciousness.length <= 105\n\t0 <= deliciousness[i] <= 220\n\n"
