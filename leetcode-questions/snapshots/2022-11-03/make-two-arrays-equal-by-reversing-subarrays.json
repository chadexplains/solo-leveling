  "description": "You are given two integer arrays of equal length target and arr. In one step, you can select any non-empty subarray of arr and reverse it. You are allowed to make any number of steps.\n\nReturn true if you can make arr equal to target or false otherwise.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: target = [1,2,3,4], arr = [2,4,1,3]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: You can follow the next steps to convert arr to target:\n1- Reverse subarray [2,4,1], arr becomes [1,4,2,3]\n2- Reverse subarray [4,2], arr becomes [1,2,4,3]\n3- Reverse subarray [4,3], arr becomes [1,2,3,4]\nThere are multiple ways to convert arr to target, this is not the only way to do so.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: target = [7], arr = [7]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: arr is equal to target without any reverses.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: target = [3,7,9], arr = [3,7,11]\nOutput: false\nExplanation: arr does not have value 9 and it can never be converted to target.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\ttarget.length == arr.length\n\t1 <= target.length <= 1000\n\t1 <= target[i] <= 1000\n\t1 <= arr[i] <= 1000\n\n"
