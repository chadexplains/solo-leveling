  "description": "You are given two strings word1 and word2. You want to construct a string merge in the following way: while either word1 or word2 are non-empty, choose one of the following options:\n\n\n\tIf word1 is non-empty, append the first character in word1 to merge and delete it from word1.\n\n\t\n\t\tFor example, if word1 = \"abc\" and merge = \"dv\", then after choosing this operation, word1 = \"bc\" and merge = \"dva\".\n\t\n\t\n\tIf word2 is non-empty, append the first character in word2 to merge and delete it from word2.\n\t\n\t\tFor example, if word2 = \"abc\" and merge = \"\", then after choosing this operation, word2 = \"bc\" and merge = \"a\".\n\t\n\t\n\n\nReturn the lexicographically largest merge you can construct.\n\nA string a is lexicographically larger than a string b (of the same length) if in the first position where a and b differ, a has a character strictly larger than the corresponding character in b. For example, \"abcd\" is lexicographically larger than \"abcc\" because the first position they differ is at the fourth character, and d is greater than c.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: word1 = \"cabaa\", word2 = \"bcaaa\"\nOutput: \"cbcabaaaaa\"\nExplanation: One way to get the lexicographically largest merge is:\n- Take from word1: merge = \"c\", word1 = \"abaa\", word2 = \"bcaaa\"\n- Take from word2: merge = \"cb\", word1 = \"abaa\", word2 = \"caaa\"\n- Take from word2: merge = \"cbc\", word1 = \"abaa\", word2 = \"aaa\"\n- Take from word1: merge = \"cbca\", word1 = \"baa\", word2 = \"aaa\"\n- Take from word1: merge = \"cbcab\", word1 = \"aa\", word2 = \"aaa\"\n- Append the remaining 5 a's from word1 and word2 at the end of merge.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: word1 = \"abcabc\", word2 = \"abdcaba\"\nOutput: \"abdcabcabcaba\"\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 3000\n\tword1 and word2 consist only of lowercase English letters.\n\n"
