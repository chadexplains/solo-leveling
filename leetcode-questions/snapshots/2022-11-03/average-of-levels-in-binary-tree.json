  "description": "Given the root of a binary tree, return the average value of the nodes on each level in the form of an array. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]\nOutput: [3.00000,14.50000,11.00000]\nExplanation: The average value of nodes on level 0 is 3, on level 1 is 14.5, and on level 2 is 11.\nHence return [3, 14.5, 11].\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: root = [3,9,20,15,7]\nOutput: [3.00000,14.50000,11.00000]\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\tThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].\n\t-231 <= Node.val <= 231 - 1\n\n"
