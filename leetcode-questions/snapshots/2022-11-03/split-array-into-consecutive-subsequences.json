  "description": "You are given an integer array nums that is sorted in non-decreasing order.\n\nDetermine if it is possible to split nums into one or more subsequences such that both of the following conditions are true:\n\n\n\tEach subsequence is a consecutive increasing sequence (i.e. each integer is exactly one more than the previous integer).\n\tAll subsequences have a length of 3 or more.\n\n\nReturn true if you can split nums according to the above conditions, or false otherwise.\n\nA subsequence of an array is a new array that is formed from the original array by deleting some (can be none) of the elements without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining elements. (i.e., [1,3,5] is a subsequence of [1,2,3,4,5] while [1,3,2] is not).\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [1,2,3,3,4,5]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: nums can be split into the following subsequences:\n[1,2,3,3,4,5] --> 1, 2, 3\n[1,2,3,3,4,5] --> 3, 4, 5\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [1,2,3,3,4,4,5,5]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: nums can be split into the following subsequences:\n[1,2,3,3,4,4,5,5] --> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n[1,2,3,3,4,4,5,5] --> 3, 4, 5\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: nums = [1,2,3,4,4,5]\nOutput: false\nExplanation: It is impossible to split nums into consecutive increasing subsequences of length 3 or more.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= nums.length <= 104\n\t-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000\n\tnums is sorted in non-decreasing order.\n\n"
