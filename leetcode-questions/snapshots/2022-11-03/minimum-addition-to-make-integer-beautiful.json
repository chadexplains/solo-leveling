  "description": "You are given two positive integers n and target.\n\nAn integer is considered beautiful if the sum of its digits is less than or equal to target.\n\nReturn the minimum non-negative integer x such that n + x is beautiful. The input will be generated such that it is always possible to make n beautiful.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: n = 16, target = 6\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: Initially n is 16 and its digit sum is 1 + 6 = 7. After adding 4, n becomes 20 and digit sum becomes 2 + 0 = 2. It can be shown that we can not make n beautiful with adding non-negative integer less than 4.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: n = 467, target = 6\nOutput: 33\nExplanation: Initially n is 467 and its digit sum is 4 + 6 + 7 = 17. After adding 33, n becomes 500 and digit sum becomes 5 + 0 + 0 = 5. It can be shown that we can not make n beautiful with adding non-negative integer less than 33.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: n = 1, target = 1\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: Initially n is 1 and its digit sum is 1, which is already smaller than or equal to target.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= n <= 1012\n\t1 <= target <= 150\n\tThe input will be generated such that it is always possible to make n beautiful.\n\n"
