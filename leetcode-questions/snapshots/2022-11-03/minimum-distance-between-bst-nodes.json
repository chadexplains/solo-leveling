  "description": "Given the root of a Binary Search Tree (BST), return the minimum difference between the values of any two different nodes in the tree.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: root = [4,2,6,1,3]\nOutput: 1\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: root = [1,0,48,null,null,12,49]\nOutput: 1\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\tThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 100].\n\t0 <= Node.val <= 105\n\n\n \nNote: This question is the same as 530: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-absolute-difference-in-bst/\n"
