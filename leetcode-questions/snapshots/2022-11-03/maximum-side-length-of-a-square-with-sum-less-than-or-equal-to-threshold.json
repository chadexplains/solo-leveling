  "description": "Given a m x n matrix mat and an integer threshold, return the maximum side-length of a square with a sum less than or equal to threshold or return 0 if there is no such square.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: mat = [[1,1,3,2,4,3,2],[1,1,3,2,4,3,2],[1,1,3,2,4,3,2]], threshold = 4\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: The maximum side length of square with sum less than 4 is 2 as shown.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: mat = [[2,2,2,2,2],[2,2,2,2,2],[2,2,2,2,2],[2,2,2,2,2],[2,2,2,2,2]], threshold = 1\nOutput: 0\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\tm == mat.length\n\tn == mat[i].length\n\t1 <= m, n <= 300\n\t0 <= mat[i][j] <= 104\n\t0 <= threshold <= 105\n\n"
