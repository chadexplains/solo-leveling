  "description": "An axis-aligned rectangle is represented as a list [x1, y1, x2, y2], where (x1, y1) is the coordinate of its bottom-left corner, and (x2, y2) is the coordinate of its top-right corner. Its top and bottom edges are parallel to the X-axis, and its left and right edges are parallel to the Y-axis.\n\nTwo rectangles overlap if the area of their intersection is positive. To be clear, two rectangles that only touch at the corner or edges do not overlap.\n\nGiven two axis-aligned rectangles rec1 and rec2, return true if they overlap, otherwise return false.\n\n \nExample 1:\nInput: rec1 = [0,0,2,2], rec2 = [1,1,3,3]\nOutput: true\nExample 2:\nInput: rec1 = [0,0,1,1], rec2 = [1,0,2,1]\nOutput: false\nExample 3:\nInput: rec1 = [0,0,1,1], rec2 = [2,2,3,3]\nOutput: false\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\trec1.length == 4\n\trec2.length == 4\n\t-109 <= rec1[i], rec2[i] <= 109\n\trec1 and rec2 represent a valid rectangle with a non-zero area.\n\n"
