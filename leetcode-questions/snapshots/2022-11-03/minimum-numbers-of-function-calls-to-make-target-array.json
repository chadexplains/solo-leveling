  "description": "You are given an integer array nums. You have an integer array arr of the same length with all values set to 0 initially. You also have the following modify function:\n\nYou want to use the modify function to covert arr to nums using the minimum number of calls.\n\nReturn the minimum number of function calls to make nums from arr.\n\nThe test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a 32-bit signed integer.\n\nÂ \nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [1,5]\nOutput: 5\nExplanation: Increment by 1 (second element): [0, 0] to get [0, 1] (1 operation).\nDouble all the elements: [0, 1] -> [0, 2] -> [0, 4] (2 operations).\nIncrement by 1 (both elements)  [0, 4] -> [1, 4] -> [1, 5] (2 operations).\nTotal of operations: 1 + 2 + 2 = 5.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [2,2]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: Increment by 1 (both elements) [0, 0] -> [0, 1] -> [1, 1] (2 operations).\nDouble all the elements: [1, 1] -> [2, 2] (1 operation).\nTotal of operations: 2 + 1 = 3.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: nums = [4,2,5]\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: (initial)[0,0,0] -> [1,0,0] -> [1,0,1] -> [2,0,2] -> [2,1,2] -> [4,2,4] -> [4,2,5](nums).\n\n\nÂ \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= nums.length <= 105\n\t0 <= nums[i] <= 109\n\n"
