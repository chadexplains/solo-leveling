It is also guaranteed that each 'Buy' operation for a stock has a corresponding 'Sell' operation in an upcoming day.\n\n\n \n\nWrite an SQL query to report the Capital gain/loss for each stock.\n\nThe Capital gain/loss of a stock is the total gain or loss after buying and selling the stock one or many times.\n\nReturn the result table in any order.\n\nThe query result format is in the following example.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: \nStocks table:\n+---------------+-----------+---------------+--------+\n| stock_name    | operation | operation_day | price  |\n+---------------+-----------+---------------+--------+\n| Leetcode      | Buy       | 1             | 1000   |\n| Corona Masks  | Buy       | 2             | 10     |\n| Leetcode      | Sell      | 5             | 9000   |\n| Handbags      | Buy       | 17            | 30000  |\n| Corona Masks  | Sell      | 3             | 1010   |\n| Corona Masks  | Buy       | 4             | 1000   |\n| Corona Masks  | Sell      | 5             | 500    |\n| Corona Masks  | Buy       | 6             | 1000   |\n| Handbags      | Sell      | 29            | 7000   |\n| Corona Masks  | Sell      | 10            | 10000  |\n+---------------+-----------+---------------+--------+\nOutput: \n+---------------+-------------------+\n| stock_name    | capital_gain_loss |\n+---------------+-------------------+\n| Corona Masks  | 9500              |\n| Leetcode      | 8000              |\n| Handbags      | -23000            |\n+---------------+-------------------+\nExplanation: \nLeetcode stock was bought at day 1 for 1000$ and was sold at day 5 for 9000$. Capital gain = 9000 - 1000 = 8000$.\nHandbags stock was bought at day 17 for 30000$ and was sold at day 29 for 7000$. Capital loss = 7000 - 30000 = -23000$.\nCorona Masks stock was bought at day 1 for 10$ and was sold at day 3 for 1010$. It was bought again at day 4 for 1000$ and was sold at day 5 for 500$. At last, it was bought at day 6 for 1000$ and was sold at day 10 for 10000$. Capital gain/loss is the sum of capital gains/losses for each ('Buy' --> 'Sell') operation = (1010 - 10) + (500 - 1000) + (10000 - 1000) = 1000 - 500 + 9000 = 9500$.\n\n"
