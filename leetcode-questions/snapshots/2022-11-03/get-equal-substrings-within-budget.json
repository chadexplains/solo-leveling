  "description": "You are given two strings s and t of the same length and an integer maxCost.\n\nYou want to change s to t. Changing the ith character of s to ith character of t costs |s[i] - t[i]| (i.e., the absolute difference between the ASCII values of the characters).\n\nReturn the maximum length of a substring of s that can be changed to be the same as the corresponding substring of t with a cost less than or equal to maxCost. If there is no substring from s that can be changed to its corresponding substring from t, return 0.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = \"abcd\", t = \"bcdf\", maxCost = 3\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: \"abc\" of s can change to \"bcd\".\nThat costs 3, so the maximum length is 3.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s = \"abcd\", t = \"cdef\", maxCost = 3\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: Each character in s costs 2 to change to character in t,  so the maximum length is 1.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: s = \"abcd\", t = \"acde\", maxCost = 0\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: You cannot make any change, so the maximum length is 1.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= s.length <= 105\n\tt.length == s.length\n\t0 <= maxCost <= 106\n\ts and t consist of only lowercase English letters.\n\n"
