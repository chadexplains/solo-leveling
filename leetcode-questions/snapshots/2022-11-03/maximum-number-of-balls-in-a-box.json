  "description": "You are working in a ball factory where you have n balls numbered from lowLimit up to highLimit inclusive (i.e., n == highLimit - lowLimit + 1), and an infinite number of boxes numbered from 1 to infinity.\n\nYour job at this factory is to put each ball in the box with a number equal to the sum of digits of the ball's number. For example, the ball number 321 will be put in the box number 3 + 2 + 1 = 6 and the ball number 10 will be put in the box number 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nGiven two integers lowLimit and highLimit, return the number of balls in the box with the most balls.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: lowLimit = 1, highLimit = 10\nOutput: 2\nExplanation:\nBox Number:  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 ...\nBall Count:  2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0  0  ...\nBox 1 has the most number of balls with 2 balls.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: lowLimit = 5, highLimit = 15\nOutput: 2\nExplanation:\nBox Number:  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 ...\nBall Count:  1 1 1 1 2 2 1 1 1 0  0  ...\nBoxes 5 and 6 have the most number of balls with 2 balls in each.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: lowLimit = 19, highLimit = 28\nOutput: 2\nExplanation:\nBox Number:  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 ...\nBall Count:  0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2  0  0  ...\nBox 10 has the most number of balls with 2 balls.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= lowLimit <= highLimit <= 105\n\n"
