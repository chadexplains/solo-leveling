  "description": "You are given an integer array heights representing the heights of buildings, some bricks, and some ladders.\n\nYou start your journey from building 0 and move to the next building by possibly using bricks or ladders.\n\nWhile moving from building i to building i+1 (0-indexed),\n\n\n\tIf the current building's height is greater than or equal to the next building's height, you do not need a ladder or bricks.\n\tIf the current building's height is less than the next building's height, you can either use one ladder or (h[i+1] - h[i]) bricks.\n\n\nReturn the furthest building index (0-indexed) you can reach if you use the given ladders and bricks optimally.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: heights = [4,2,7,6,9,14,12], bricks = 5, ladders = 1\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: Starting at building 0, you can follow these steps:\n- Go to building 1 without using ladders nor bricks since 4 >= 2.\n- Go to building 2 using 5 bricks. You must use either bricks or ladders because 2 < 7.\n- Go to building 3 without using ladders nor bricks since 7 >= 6.\n- Go to building 4 using your only ladder. You must use either bricks or ladders because 6 < 9.\nIt is impossible to go beyond building 4 because you do not have any more bricks or ladders.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: heights = [4,12,2,7,3,18,20,3,19], bricks = 10, ladders = 2\nOutput: 7\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: heights = [14,3,19,3], bricks = 17, ladders = 0\nOutput: 3\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= heights.length <= 105\n\t1 <= heights[i] <= 106\n\t0 <= bricks <= 109\n\t0 <= ladders <= heights.length\n\n"
