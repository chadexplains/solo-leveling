  "description": "On an infinite plane, a robot initially stands at (0, 0) and faces north. Note that:\n\n\n\tThe north direction is the positive direction of the y-axis.\n\tThe south direction is the negative direction of the y-axis.\n\tThe east direction is the positive direction of the x-axis.\n\tThe west direction is the negative direction of the x-axis.\n\n\nThe robot can receive one of three instructions:\n\n\n\t\"G\": go straight 1 unit.\n\t\"L\": turn 90 degrees to the left (i.e., anti-clockwise direction).\n\t\"R\": turn 90 degrees to the right (i.e., clockwise direction).\n\n\nThe robot performs the instructions given in order, and repeats them forever.\n\nReturn true if and only if there exists a circle in the plane such that the robot never leaves the circle.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: instructions = \"GGLLGG\"\nOutput: true\nExplanation: The robot is initially at (0, 0) facing the north direction.\n\"G\": move one step. Position: (0, 1). Direction: North.\n\"G\": move one step. Position: (0, 2). Direction: North.\n\"L\": turn 90 degrees anti-clockwise. Position: (0, 2). Direction: West.\n\"L\": turn 90 degrees anti-clockwise. Position: (0, 2). Direction: South.\n\"G\": move one step. Position: (0, 1). Direction: South.\n\"G\": move one step. Position: (0, 0). Direction: South.\nRepeating the instructions, the robot goes into the cycle: (0, 0) --> (0, 1) --> (0, 2) --> (0, 1) --> (0, 0).\nBased on that, we return true.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: instructions = \"GG\"\nOutput: false\nExplanation: The robot is initially at (0, 0) facing the north direction.\n\"G\": move one step. Position: (0, 1). Direction: North.\n\"G\": move one step. Position: (0, 2). Direction: North.\nRepeating the instructions, keeps advancing in the north direction and does not go into cycles.\nBased on that, we return false.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: instructions = \"GL\"\nOutput: true\nExplanation: The robot is initially at (0, 0) facing the north direction.\n\"G\": move one step. Position: (0, 1). Direction: North.\n\"L\": turn 90 degrees anti-clockwise. Position: (0, 1). Direction: West.\n\"G\": move one step. Position: (-1, 1). Direction: West.\n\"L\": turn 90 degrees anti-clockwise. Position: (-1, 1). Direction: South.\n\"G\": move one step. Position: (-1, 0). Direction: South.\n\"L\": turn 90 degrees anti-clockwise. Position: (-1, 0). Direction: East.\n\"G\": move one step. Position: (0, 0). Direction: East.\n\"L\": turn 90 degrees anti-clockwise. Position: (0, 0). Direction: North.\nRepeating the instructions, the robot goes into the cycle: (0, 0) --> (0, 1) --> (-1, 1) --> (-1, 0) --> (0, 0).\nBased on that, we return true.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= instructions.length <= 100\n\tinstructions[i] is 'G', 'L' or, 'R'.\n\n"
