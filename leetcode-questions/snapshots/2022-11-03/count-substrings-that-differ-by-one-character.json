  "description": "Given two strings s and t, find the number of ways you can choose a non-empty substring of s and replace a single character by a different character such that the resulting substring is a substring of t. In other words, find the number of substrings in s that differ from some substring in t by exactly one character.\n\nFor example, the underlined substrings in \"computer\" and \"computation\" only differ by the 'e'/'a', so this is a valid way.\n\nReturn the number of substrings that satisfy the condition above.\n\nA substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = \"aba\", t = \"baba\"\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: The following are the pairs of substrings from s and t that differ by exactly 1 character:\n(\"aba\", \"baba\")\n(\"aba\", \"baba\")\n(\"aba\", \"baba\")\n(\"aba\", \"baba\")\n(\"aba\", \"baba\")\n(\"aba\", \"baba\")\nThe underlined portions are the substrings that are chosen from s and t.\n\n​​Example 2:\n\nInput: s = \"ab\", t = \"bb\"\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: The following are the pairs of substrings from s and t that differ by 1 character:\n(\"ab\", \"bb\")\n(\"ab\", \"bb\")\n(\"ab\", \"bb\")\n​​​​The underlined portions are the substrings that are chosen from s and t.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= s.length, t.length <= 100\n\ts and t consist of lowercase English letters only.\n\n"
