  "description": "Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k, return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).\n\nThe distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., √(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2).\n\nYou may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], k = 1\nOutput: [[-2,2]]\nExplanation:\nThe distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).\nThe distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).\nSince sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.\nWe only want the closest k = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just [[-2,2]].\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], k = 2\nOutput: [[3,3],[-2,4]]\nExplanation: The answer [[-2,4],[3,3]] would also be accepted.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= k <= points.length <= 104\n\t-104 < xi, yi < 104\n\n"
