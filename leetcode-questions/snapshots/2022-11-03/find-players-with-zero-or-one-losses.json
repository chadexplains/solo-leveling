  "description": "You are given an integer array matches where matches[i] = [winneri, loseri] indicates that the player winneri defeated player loseri in a match.\n\nReturn a list answer of size 2 where:\n\n\n\tanswer[0] is a list of all players that have not lost any matches.\n\tanswer[1] is a list of all players that have lost exactly one match.\n\n\nThe values in the two lists should be returned in increasing order.\n\nNote:\n\n\n\tYou should only consider the players that have played at least one match.\n\tThe testcases will be generated such that no two matches will have the same outcome.\n\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: matches = [[1,3],[2,3],[3,6],[5,6],[5,7],[4,5],[4,8],[4,9],[10,4],[10,9]]\nOutput: [[1,2,10],[4,5,7,8]]\nExplanation:\nPlayers 1, 2, and 10 have not lost any matches.\nPlayers 4, 5, 7, and 8 each have lost one match.\nPlayers 3, 6, and 9 each have lost two matches.\nThus, answer[0] = [1,2,10] and answer[1] = [4,5,7,8].\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: matches = [[2,3],[1,3],[5,4],[6,4]]\nOutput: [[1,2,5,6],[]]\nExplanation:\nPlayers 1, 2, 5, and 6 have not lost any matches.\nPlayers 3 and 4 each have lost two matches.\nThus, answer[0] = [1,2,5,6] and answer[1] = [].\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= matches.length <= 105\n\tmatches[i].length == 2\n\t1 <= winneri, loseri <= 105\n\twinneri != loseri\n\tAll matches[i] are unique.\n\n"
