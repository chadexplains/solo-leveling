  "description": "In the \"100 game\" two players take turns adding, to a running total, any integer from 1 to 10. The player who first causes the running total to reach or exceed 100 wins.\n\nWhat if we change the game so that players cannot re-use integers?\n\nFor example, two players might take turns drawing from a common pool of numbers from 1 to 15 without replacement until they reach a total >= 100.\n\nGiven two integers maxChoosableInteger and desiredTotal, return true if the first player to move can force a win, otherwise, return false. Assume both players play optimally.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: maxChoosableInteger = 10, desiredTotal = 11\nOutput: false\nExplanation:\nNo matter which integer the first player choose, the first player will lose.\nThe first player can choose an integer from 1 up to 10.\nIf the first player choose 1, the second player can only choose integers from 2 up to 10.\nThe second player will win by choosing 10 and get a total = 11, which is >= desiredTotal.\nSame with other integers chosen by the first player, the second player will always win.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: maxChoosableInteger = 10, desiredTotal = 0\nOutput: true\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: maxChoosableInteger = 10, desiredTotal = 1\nOutput: true\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= maxChoosableInteger <= 20\n\t0 <= desiredTotal <= 300\n\n"
