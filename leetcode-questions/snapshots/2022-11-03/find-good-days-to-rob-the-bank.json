  "description": "You and a gang of thieves are planning on robbing a bank. You are given a 0-indexed integer array security, where security[i] is the number of guards on duty on the ith day. The days are numbered starting from 0. You are also given an integer time.\n\nThe ith day is a good day to rob the bank if:\n\n\n\tThere are at least time days before and after the ith day,\n\tThe number of guards at the bank for the time days before i are non-increasing, and\n\tThe number of guards at the bank for the time days after i are non-decreasing.\n\n\nMore formally, this means day i is a good day to rob the bank if and only if security[i - time] >= security[i - time + 1] >= ... >= security[i] <= ... <= security[i + time - 1] <= security[i + time].\n\nReturn a list of all days (0-indexed) that are good days to rob the bank. The order that the days are returned in does not matter.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: security = [5,3,3,3,5,6,2], time = 2\nOutput: [2,3]\nExplanation:\nOn day 2, we have security[0] >= security[1] >= security[2] <= security[3] <= security[4].\nOn day 3, we have security[1] >= security[2] >= security[3] <= security[4] <= security[5].\nNo other days satisfy this condition, so days 2 and 3 are the only good days to rob the bank.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: security = [1,1,1,1,1], time = 0\nOutput: [0,1,2,3,4]\nExplanation:\nSince time equals 0, every day is a good day to rob the bank, so return every day.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: security = [1,2,3,4,5,6], time = 2\nOutput: []\nExplanation:\nNo day has 2 days before it that have a non-increasing number of guards.\nThus, no day is a good day to rob the bank, so return an empty list.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= security.length <= 105\n\t0 <= security[i], time <= 105\n\n"
