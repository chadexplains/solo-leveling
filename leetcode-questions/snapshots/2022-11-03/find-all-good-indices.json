  "description": "You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums of size n and a positive integer k.\n\nWe call an index i in the range k <= i < n - k good if the following conditions are satisfied:\n\n\n\tThe k elements that are just before the index i are in non-increasing order.\n\tThe k elements that are just after the index i are in non-decreasing order.\n\n\nReturn an array of all good indices sorted in increasing order.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [2,1,1,1,3,4,1], k = 2\nOutput: [2,3]\nExplanation: There are two good indices in the array:\n- Index 2. The subarray [2,1] is in non-increasing order, and the subarray [1,3] is in non-decreasing order.\n- Index 3. The subarray [1,1] is in non-increasing order, and the subarray [3,4] is in non-decreasing order.\nNote that the index 4 is not good because [4,1] is not non-decreasing.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [2,1,1,2], k = 2\nOutput: []\nExplanation: There are no good indices in this array.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\tn == nums.length\n\t3 <= n <= 105\n\t1 <= nums[i] <= 106\n\t1 <= k <= n / 2\n\n"
