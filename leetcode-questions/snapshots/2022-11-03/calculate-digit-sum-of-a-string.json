  "description": "You are given a string s consisting of digits and an integer k.\n\nA round can be completed if the length of s is greater than k. In one round, do the following:\n\n\n\tDivide s into consecutive groups of size k such that the first k characters are in the first group, the next k characters are in the second group, and so on. Note that the size of the last group can be smaller than k.\n\tReplace each group of s with a string representing the sum of all its digits. For example, \"346\" is replaced with \"13\" because 3 + 4 + 6 = 13.\n\tMerge consecutive groups together to form a new string. If the length of the string is greater than k, repeat from step 1.\n\n\nReturn s after all rounds have been completed.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = \"11111222223\", k = 3\nOutput: \"135\"\nExplanation: \n- For the first round, we divide s into groups of size 3: \"111\", \"112\", \"222\", and \"23\".\n  ​​​​​Then we calculate the digit sum of each group: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, 1 + 1 + 2 = 4, 2 + 2 + 2 = 6, and 2 + 3 = 5. \n  So, s becomes \"3\" + \"4\" + \"6\" + \"5\" = \"3465\" after the first round.\n- For the second round, we divide s into \"346\" and \"5\".\n  Then we calculate the digit sum of each group: 3 + 4 + 6 = 13, 5 = 5. \n  So, s becomes \"13\" + \"5\" = \"135\" after second round. \nNow, s.length <= k, so we return \"135\" as the answer.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s = \"00000000\", k = 3\nOutput: \"000\"\nExplanation: \nWe divide s into \"000\", \"000\", and \"00\".\nThen we calculate the digit sum of each group: 0 + 0 + 0 = 0, 0 + 0 + 0 = 0, and 0 + 0 = 0. \ns becomes \"0\" + \"0\" + \"0\" = \"000\", whose length is equal to k, so we return \"000\".\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= s.length <= 100\n\t2 <= k <= 100\n\ts consists of digits only.\n\n"
