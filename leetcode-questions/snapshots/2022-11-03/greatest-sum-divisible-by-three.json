  "description": "Given an integer array nums, return the maximum possible sum of elements of the array such that it is divisible by three.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [3,6,5,1,8]\nOutput: 18\nExplanation: Pick numbers 3, 6, 1 and 8 their sum is 18 (maximum sum divisible by 3).\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [4]\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: Since 4 is not divisible by 3, do not pick any number.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: nums = [1,2,3,4,4]\nOutput: 12\nExplanation: Pick numbers 1, 3, 4 and 4 their sum is 12 (maximum sum divisible by 3).\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= nums.length <= 4 * 104\n\t1 <= nums[i] <= 104\n\n"
