  "description": "Given an integer array nums of size n, return the number with the value closest to 0 in nums. If there are multiple answers, return the number with the largest value.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [-4,-2,1,4,8]\nOutput: 1\nExplanation:\nThe distance from -4 to 0 is |-4| = 4.\nThe distance from -2 to 0 is |-2| = 2.\nThe distance from 1 to 0 is |1| = 1.\nThe distance from 4 to 0 is |4| = 4.\nThe distance from 8 to 0 is |8| = 8.\nThus, the closest number to 0 in the array is 1.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [2,-1,1]\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: 1 and -1 are both the closest numbers to 0, so 1 being larger is returned.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= n <= 1000\n\t-105 <= nums[i] <= 105\n\n"
