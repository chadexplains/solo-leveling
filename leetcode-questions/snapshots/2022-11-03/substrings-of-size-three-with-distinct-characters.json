  "description": "A string is good if there are no repeated characters.\n\nGiven a string s​​​​​, return the number of good substrings of length three in s​​​​​​.\n\nNote that if there are multiple occurrences of the same substring, every occurrence should be counted.\n\nA substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = \"xyzzaz\"\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: There are 4 substrings of size 3: \"xyz\", \"yzz\", \"zza\", and \"zaz\". \nThe only good substring of length 3 is \"xyz\".\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s = \"aababcabc\"\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: There are 7 substrings of size 3: \"aab\", \"aba\", \"bab\", \"abc\", \"bca\", \"cab\", and \"abc\".\nThe good substrings are \"abc\", \"bca\", \"cab\", and \"abc\".\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= s.length <= 100\n\ts​​​​​​ consists of lowercase English letters.\n\n"
