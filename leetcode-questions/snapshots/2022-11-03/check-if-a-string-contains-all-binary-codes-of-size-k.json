  "description": "Given a binary string s and an integer k, return true if every binary code of length k is a substring of s. Otherwise, return false.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = \"00110110\", k = 2\nOutput: true\nExplanation: The binary codes of length 2 are \"00\", \"01\", \"10\" and \"11\". They can be all found as substrings at indices 0, 1, 3 and 2 respectively.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s = \"0110\", k = 1\nOutput: true\nExplanation: The binary codes of length 1 are \"0\" and \"1\", it is clear that both exist as a substring. \n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: s = \"0110\", k = 2\nOutput: false\nExplanation: The binary code \"00\" is of length 2 and does not exist in the array.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= s.length <= 5 * 105\n\ts[i] is either '0' or '1'.\n\t1 <= k <= 20\n\n"
