  "description": "An n x n grid is composed of 1 x 1 squares where each 1 x 1 square consists of a '/', '\\', or blank space ' '. These characters divide the square into contiguous regions.\n\nGiven the grid grid represented as a string array, return the number of regions.\n\nNote that backslash characters are escaped, so a '\\' is represented as '\\\\'.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: grid = [\" /\",\"/ \"]\nOutput: 2\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: grid = [\" /\",\"  \"]\nOutput: 1\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: grid = [\"/\\\\\",\"\\\\/\"]\nOutput: 5\nExplanation: Recall that because \\ characters are escaped, \"\\\\/\" refers to \\/, and \"/\\\\\" refers to /\\.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\tn == grid.length == grid[i].length\n\t1 <= n <= 30\n\tgrid[i][j] is either '/', '\\', or ' '.\n\n"
