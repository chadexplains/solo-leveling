  "description": "There are n people that are split into some unknown number of groups. Each person is labeled with a unique ID from 0 to n - 1.\n\nYou are given an integer array groupSizes, where groupSizes[i] is the size of the group that person i is in. For example, if groupSizes[1] = 3, then person 1 must be in a group of size 3.\n\nReturn a list of groups such that each person i is in a group of size groupSizes[i].\n\nEach person should appear in exactly one group, and every person must be in a group. If there are multiple answers, return any of them. It is guaranteed that there will be at least one valid solution for the given input.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: groupSizes = [3,3,3,3,3,1,3]\nOutput: [[5],[0,1,2],[3,4,6]]\nExplanation: \nThe first group is [5]. The size is 1, and groupSizes[5] = 1.\nThe second group is [0,1,2]. The size is 3, and groupSizes[0] = groupSizes[1] = groupSizes[2] = 3.\nThe third group is [3,4,6]. The size is 3, and groupSizes[3] = groupSizes[4] = groupSizes[6] = 3.\nOther possible solutions are [[2,1,6],[5],[0,4,3]] and [[5],[0,6,2],[4,3,1]].\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: groupSizes = [2,1,3,3,3,2]\nOutput: [[1],[0,5],[2,3,4]]\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\tgroupSizes.length == n\n\t1 <= n <= 500\n\t1 <= groupSizes[i] <= n\n\n"
