  "description": "Given a m x n matrix grid which is sorted in non-increasing order both row-wise and column-wise, return the number of negative numbers in grid.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: grid = [[4,3,2,-1],[3,2,1,-1],[1,1,-1,-2],[-1,-1,-2,-3]]\nOutput: 8\nExplanation: There are 8 negatives number in the matrix.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: grid = [[3,2],[1,0]]\nOutput: 0\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\tm == grid.length\n\tn == grid[i].length\n\t1 <= m, n <= 100\n\t-100 <= grid[i][j] <= 100\n\n\n \nFollow up: Could you find an O(n + m) solution?"
