  "description": "On a single-threaded CPU, we execute a program containing n functions. Each function has a unique ID between 0 and n-1.\n\nFunction calls are stored in a call stack: when a function call starts, its ID is pushed onto the stack, and when a function call ends, its ID is popped off the stack. The function whose ID is at the top of the stack is the current function being executed. Each time a function starts or ends, we write a log with the ID, whether it started or ended, and the timestamp.\n\nYou are given a list logs, where logs[i] represents the ith log message formatted as a string \"{function_id}:{\"start\" | \"end\"}:{timestamp}\". For example, \"0:start:3\" means a function call with function ID 0 started at the beginning of timestamp 3, and \"1:end:2\" means a function call with function ID 1 ended at the end of timestamp 2. Note that a function can be called multiple times, possibly recursively.\n\nA function's exclusive time is the sum of execution times for all function calls in the program. For example, if a function is called twice, one call executing for 2 time units and another call executing for 1 time unit, the exclusive time is 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nReturn the exclusive time of each function in an array, where the value at the ith index represents the exclusive time for the function with ID i.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: n = 2, logs = [\"0:start:0\",\"1:start:2\",\"1:end:5\",\"0:end:6\"]\nOutput: [3,4]\nExplanation:\nFunction 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, then it executes 2 for units of time and reaches the end of time 1.\nFunction 1 starts at the beginning of time 2, executes for 4 units of time, and ends at the end of time 5.\nFunction 0 resumes execution at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 1 unit of time.\nSo function 0 spends 2 + 1 = 3 units of total time executing, and function 1 spends 4 units of total time executing.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: n = 1, logs = [\"0:start:0\",\"0:start:2\",\"0:end:5\",\"0:start:6\",\"0:end:6\",\"0:end:7\"]\nOutput: [8]\nExplanation:\nFunction 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, executes for 2 units of time, and recursively calls itself.\nFunction 0 (recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 2 and executes for 4 units of time.\nFunction 0 (initial call) resumes execution then immediately calls itself again.\nFunction 0 (2nd recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 1 unit of time.\nFunction 0 (initial call) resumes execution at the beginning of time 7 and executes for 1 unit of time.\nSo function 0 spends 2 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 8 units of total time executing.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: n = 2, logs = [\"0:start:0\",\"0:start:2\",\"0:end:5\",\"1:start:6\",\"1:end:6\",\"0:end:7\"]\nOutput: [7,1]\nExplanation:\nFunction 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, executes for 2 units of time, and recursively calls itself.\nFunction 0 (recursive call) starts at the beginning of time 2 and executes for 4 units of time.\nFunction 0 (initial call) resumes execution then immediately calls function 1.\nFunction 1 starts at the beginning of time 6, executes 1 unit of time, and ends at the end of time 6.\nFunction 0 resumes execution at the beginning of time 6 and executes for 2 units of time.\nSo function 0 spends 2 + 4 + 1 = 7 units of total time executing, and function 1 spends 1 unit of total time executing.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= n <= 100\n\t1 <= logs.length <= 500\n\t0 <= function_id < n\n\t0 <= timestamp <= 109\n\tNo two start events will happen at the same timestamp.\n\tNo two end events will happen at the same timestamp.\n\tEach function has an \"end\" log for each \"start\" log.\n\n"
