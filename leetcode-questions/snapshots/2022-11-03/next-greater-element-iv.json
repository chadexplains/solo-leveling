  "description": "You are given a 0-indexed array of non-negative integers nums. For each integer in nums, you must find its respective second greater integer.\n\nThe second greater integer of nums[i] is nums[j] such that:\n\n\n\tj > i\n\tnums[j] > nums[i]\n\tThere exists exactly one index k such that nums[k] > nums[i] and i < k < j.\n\n\nIf there is no such nums[j], the second greater integer is considered to be -1.\n\n\n\tFor example, in the array [1, 2, 4, 3], the second greater integer of 1 is 4, 2 is 3,Â and that of 3 and 4 is -1.\n\n\nReturn an integer array answer, where answer[i] is the second greater integer of nums[i].\n\nÂ \nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [2,4,0,9,6]\nOutput: [9,6,6,-1,-1]\nExplanation:\n0th index: 4 is the first integer greater than 2, and 9 is the second integer greater than 2, to the right of 2.\n1st index: 9 is the first, and 6 is the second integer greater than 4, to the right of 4.\n2nd index: 9 is the first, and 6 is the second integer greater than 0, to the right of 0.\n3rd index: There is no integer greater than 9 to its right, so the second greater integer is considered to be -1.\n4th index: There is no integer greater than 6 to its right, so the second greater integer is considered to be -1.\nThus, we return [9,6,6,-1,-1].\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [3,3]\nOutput: [-1,-1]\nExplanation:\nWe return [-1,-1] since neither integer has any integer greater than it.\n\n\nÂ \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= nums.length <= 105\n\t0 <= nums[i] <= 109\n\n"
