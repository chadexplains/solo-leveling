  "description": "There is a hidden integer array arr that consists of n non-negative integers.\n\nIt was encoded into another integer array encoded of length n - 1, such that encoded[i] = arr[i] XOR arr[i + 1]. For example, if arr = [1,0,2,1], then encoded = [1,2,3].\n\nYou are given the encoded array. You are also given an integer first, that is the first element of arr, i.e. arr[0].\n\nReturn the original array arr. It can be proved that the answer exists and is unique.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: encoded = [1,2,3], first = 1\nOutput: [1,0,2,1]\nExplanation: If arr = [1,0,2,1], then first = 1 and encoded = [1 XOR 0, 0 XOR 2, 2 XOR 1] = [1,2,3]\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: encoded = [6,2,7,3], first = 4\nOutput: [4,2,0,7,4]\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t2 <= n <= 104\n\tencoded.length == n - 1\n\t0 <= encoded[i] <= 105\n\t0 <= first <= 105\n\n"
