  "description": "Given a sentence that consists of some words separated by a single space, and a searchWord, check if searchWord is a prefix of any word in sentence.\n\nReturn the index of the word in sentence (1-indexed) where searchWord is a prefix of this word. If searchWord is a prefix of more than one word, return the index of the first word (minimum index). If there is no such word return -1.\n\nA prefix of a string s is any leading contiguous substring of s.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: sentence = \"i love eating burger\", searchWord = \"burg\"\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: \"burg\" is prefix of \"burger\" which is the 4th word in the sentence.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: sentence = \"this problem is an easy problem\", searchWord = \"pro\"\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: \"pro\" is prefix of \"problem\" which is the 2nd and the 6th word in the sentence, but we return 2 as it's the minimal index.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: sentence = \"i am tired\", searchWord = \"you\"\nOutput: -1\nExplanation: \"you\" is not a prefix of any word in the sentence.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= sentence.length <= 100\n\t1 <= searchWord.length <= 10\n\tsentence consists of lowercase English letters and spaces.\n\tsearchWord consists of lowercase English letters.\n\n"
