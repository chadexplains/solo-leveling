  "description": "Given the root of a Binary Search Tree (BST), convert it to a Greater Tree such that every key of the original BST is changed to the original key plus the sum of all keys greater than the original key in BST.\n\nAs a reminder, a binary search tree is a tree that satisfies these constraints:\n\n\n\tThe left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.\n\tThe right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.\n\tBoth the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.\n\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: root = [4,1,6,0,2,5,7,null,null,null,3,null,null,null,8]\nOutput: [30,36,21,36,35,26,15,null,null,null,33,null,null,null,8]\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: root = [0,null,1]\nOutput: [1,null,1]\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\tThe number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 100].\n\t0 <= Node.val <= 100\n\tAll the values in the tree are unique.\n\n\n \nNote: This question is the same as 538: https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-bst-to-greater-tree/\n"
