  "description": "You are given the head of a linked list, which contains a series of integers separated by 0's. The beginning and end of the linked list will have Node.val == 0.\n\nFor every two consecutive 0's, merge all the nodes lying in between them into a single node whose value is the sum of all the merged nodes. The modified list should not contain any 0's.\n\nReturn the head of the modified linked list.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: head = [0,3,1,0,4,5,2,0]\nOutput: [4,11]\nExplanation: \nThe above figure represents the given linked list. The modified list contains\n- The sum of the nodes marked in green: 3 + 1 = 4.\n- The sum of the nodes marked in red: 4 + 5 + 2 = 11.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: head = [0,1,0,3,0,2,2,0]\nOutput: [1,3,4]\nExplanation: \nThe above figure represents the given linked list. The modified list contains\n- The sum of the nodes marked in green: 1 = 1.\n- The sum of the nodes marked in red: 3 = 3.\n- The sum of the nodes marked in yellow: 2 + 2 = 4.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\tThe number of nodes in the list is in the range [3, 2 * 105].\n\t0 <= Node.val <= 1000\n\tThere are no two consecutive nodes with Node.val == 0.\n\tThe beginning and end of the linked list have Node.val == 0.\n\n"
