  "description": "You are given a 2D integer array stockPrices where stockPrices[i] = [dayi, pricei] indicates the price of the stock on day dayi is pricei. A line chart is created from the array by plotting the points on an XY plane with the X-axis representing the day and the Y-axis representing the price and connecting adjacent points. One such example is shown below:\n\nReturn the minimum number of lines needed to represent the line chart.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: stockPrices = [[1,7],[2,6],[3,5],[4,4],[5,4],[6,3],[7,2],[8,1]]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation:\nThe diagram above represents the input, with the X-axis representing the day and Y-axis representing the price.\nThe following 3 lines can be drawn to represent the line chart:\n- Line 1 (in red) from (1,7) to (4,4) passing through (1,7), (2,6), (3,5), and (4,4).\n- Line 2 (in blue) from (4,4) to (5,4).\n- Line 3 (in green) from (5,4) to (8,1) passing through (5,4), (6,3), (7,2), and (8,1).\nIt can be shown that it is not possible to represent the line chart using less than 3 lines.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: stockPrices = [[3,4],[1,2],[7,8],[2,3]]\nOutput: 1\nExplanation:\nAs shown in the diagram above, the line chart can be represented with a single line.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= stockPrices.length <= 105\n\tstockPrices[i].length == 2\n\t1 <= dayi, pricei <= 109\n\tAll dayi are distinct.\n\n"
