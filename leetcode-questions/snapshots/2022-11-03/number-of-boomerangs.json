  "description": "You are given n points in the plane that are all distinct, where points[i] = [xi, yi]. A boomerang is a tuple of points (i, j, k) such that the distance between i and j equals the distance between i and k (the order of the tuple matters).\n\nReturn the number of boomerangs.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: points = [[0,0],[1,0],[2,0]]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: The two boomerangs are [[1,0],[0,0],[2,0]] and [[1,0],[2,0],[0,0]].\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: points = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3]]\nOutput: 2\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: points = [[1,1]]\nOutput: 0\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\tn == points.length\n\t1 <= n <= 500\n\tpoints[i].length == 2\n\t-104 <= xi, yi <= 104\n\tAll the points are unique.\n\n"
