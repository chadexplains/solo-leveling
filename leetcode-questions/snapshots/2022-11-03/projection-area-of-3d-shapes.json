  "description": "You are given an n x n grid where we place some 1 x 1 x 1 cubes that are axis-aligned with the x, y, and z axes.\n\nEach value v = grid[i][j] represents a tower of v cubes placed on top of the cell (i, j).\n\nWe view the projection of these cubes onto the xy, yz, and zx planes.\n\nA projection is like a shadow, that maps our 3-dimensional figure to a 2-dimensional plane. We are viewing the \"shadow\" when looking at the cubes from the top, the front, and the side.\n\nReturn the total area of all three projections.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: grid = [[1,2],[3,4]]\nOutput: 17\nExplanation: Here are the three projections (\"shadows\") of the shape made with each axis-aligned plane.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: grid = [[2]]\nOutput: 5\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: grid = [[1,0],[0,2]]\nOutput: 8\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\tn == grid.length == grid[i].length\n\t1 <= n <= 50\n\t0 <= grid[i][j] <= 50\n\n"
