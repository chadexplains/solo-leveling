  "description": "Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. Let these two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2] where 1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length.\n\nReturn the indices of the two numbers, index1 and index2, added by one as an integer array [index1, index2] of length 2.\n\nThe tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice.\n\nYour solution must use only constant extra space.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9\nOutput: [1,2]\nExplanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore, index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6\nOutput: [1,3]\nExplanation: The sum of 2 and 4 is 6. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 3. We return [1, 3].\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: numbers = [-1,0], target = -1\nOutput: [1,2]\nExplanation: The sum of -1 and 0 is -1. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t2 <= numbers.length <= 3 * 104\n\t-1000 <= numbers[i] <= 1000\n\tnumbers is sorted in non-decreasing order.\n\t-1000 <= target <= 1000\n\tThe tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution.\n\n"
