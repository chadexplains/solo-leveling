  "description": "Given an integer array data representing the data, return whether it is a valid UTF-8 encoding (i.e. it translates to a sequence of valid UTF-8 encoded characters).\n\nA character in UTF8 can be from 1 to 4 bytes long, subjected to the following rules:\n\n\n\tFor a 1-byte character, the first bit is a 0, followed by its Unicode code.\n\tFor an n-bytes character, the first n bits are all one's, the n + 1 bit is 0, followed by n - 1 bytes with the most significant 2 bits being 10.\n\n\nThis is how the UTF-8 encoding would work:\n\n     Number of Bytes   |        UTF-8 Octet Sequence\n                       |              (binary)\n   --------------------+-----------------------------------------\n            1          |   0xxxxxxx\n            2          |   110xxxxx 10xxxxxx\n            3          |   1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx\n            4          |   11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx\n\n\nx denotes a bit in the binary form of a byte that may be either 0 or 1.\n\nNote: The input is an array of integers. Only the least significant 8 bits of each integer is used to store the data. This means each integer represents only 1 byte of data.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: data = [197,130,1]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: data represents the octet sequence: 11000101 10000010 00000001.\nIt is a valid utf-8 encoding for a 2-bytes character followed by a 1-byte character.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: data = [235,140,4]\nOutput: false\nExplanation: data represented the octet sequence: 11101011 10001100 00000100.\nThe first 3 bits are all one's and the 4th bit is 0 means it is a 3-bytes character.\nThe next byte is a continuation byte which starts with 10 and that's correct.\nBut the second continuation byte does not start with 10, so it is invalid.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 <= data.length <= 2 * 104\n\t0 <= data[i] <= 255\n\n"
