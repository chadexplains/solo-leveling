  "description": "Given the head of a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked list.\n\nIf there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: head = [1,2,3,4,5]\nOutput: [3,4,5]\nExplanation: The middle node of the list is node 3.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6]\nOutput: [4,5,6]\nExplanation: Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n\n\tThe number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 100].\n\t1 <= Node.val <= 100\n\n"
