Each trip has a unique id, while client_id and driver_id are foreign keys to the users_id at the Users table.\nStatus is an ENUM type of ('completed', 'cancelled_by_driver', 'cancelled_by_client').\n\n\n \n\nTable: Users\n\n+-------------+----------+\n| Column Name | Type     |\n+-------------+----------+\n| users_id    | int      |\n| banned      | enum     |\n| role        | enum     |\n+-------------+----------+\nusers_id is the primary key for this table.\nThe table holds all users. Each user has a unique users_id, and role is an ENUM type of ('client', 'driver', 'partner').\nbanned is an ENUM type of ('Yes', 'No').\n\n\n \n\nThe cancellation rate is computed by dividing the number of canceled (by client or driver) requests with unbanned users by the total number of requests with unbanned users on that day.\n\nWrite a SQL query to find the cancellation rate of requests with unbanned users (both client and driver must not be banned) each day between \"2013-10-01\" and \"2013-10-03\". Round Cancellation Rate to two decimal points.\n\nReturn the result table in any order.\n\nThe query result format is in the following example.\n\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: \nTrips table:\n+----+-----------+-----------+---------+---------------------+------------+\n| id | client_id | driver_id | city_id | status              | request_at |\n+----+-----------+-----------+---------+---------------------+------------+\n| 1  | 1         | 10        | 1       | completed           | 2013-10-01 |\n| 2  | 2         | 11        | 1       | cancelled_by_driver | 2013-10-01 |\n| 3  | 3         | 12        | 6       | completed           | 2013-10-01 |\n| 4  | 4         | 13        | 6       | cancelled_by_client | 2013-10-01 |\n| 5  | 1         | 10        | 1       | completed           | 2013-10-02 |\n| 6  | 2         | 11        | 6       | completed           | 2013-10-02 |\n| 7  | 3         | 12        | 6       | completed           | 2013-10-02 |\n| 8  | 2         | 12        | 12      | completed           | 2013-10-03 |\n| 9  | 3         | 10        | 12      | completed           | 2013-10-03 |\n| 10 | 4         | 13        | 12      | cancelled_by_driver | 2013-10-03 |\n+----+-----------+-----------+---------+---------------------+------------+\nUsers table:\n+----------+--------+--------+\n| users_id | banned | role   |\n+----------+--------+--------+\n| 1        | No     | client |\n| 2        | Yes    | client |\n| 3        | No     | client |\n| 4        | No     | client |\n| 10       | No     | driver |\n| 11       | No     | driver |\n| 12       | No     | driver |\n| 13       | No     | driver |\n+----------+--------+--------+\nOutput: \n+------------+-------------------+\n| Day        | Cancellation Rate |\n+------------+-------------------+\n| 2013-10-01 | 0.33              |\n| 2013-10-02 | 0.00              |\n| 2013-10-03 | 0.50              |\n+------------+-------------------+\nExplanation: \nOn 2013-10-01:\n  - There were 4 requests in total, 2 of which were canceled.\n  - However, the request with Id=2 was made by a banned client (User_Id=2), so it is ignored in the calculation.\n  - Hence there are 3 unbanned requests in total, 1 of which was canceled.\n  - The Cancellation Rate is (1 / 3) = 0.33\nOn 2013-10-02:\n  - There were 3 requests in total, 0 of which were canceled.\n  - The request with Id=6 was made by a banned client, so it is ignored.\n  - Hence there are 2 unbanned requests in total, 0 of which were canceled.\n  - The Cancellation Rate is (0 / 2) = 0.00\nOn 2013-10-03:\n  - There were 3 requests in total, 1 of which was canceled.\n  - The request with Id=8 was made by a banned client, so it is ignored.\n  - Hence there are 2 unbanned request in total, 1 of which were canceled.\n  - The Cancellation Rate is (1 / 2) = 0.50\n\n"
